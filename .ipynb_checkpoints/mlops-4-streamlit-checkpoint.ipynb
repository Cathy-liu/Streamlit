    "# User Interface to interact with a deployed model\n",
    "- Once we deploy our model on a cloud platform such as GCP Cloud Run that is accessible over the internet, we can quickly build a beautiful website to allow users to access it.\n",
    "- Strictly speaking, buinding a UI is not part of MLOps. But it is helpful to build up a portfolio of projects when you're job hunting.\n",
    "- There are many ways to build a UI using pure Python these days. DO NOT burden yourself writting pure HTML and CSS. These python libraries will do everything for you!\n",
    "    - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Most popular and allows to freely host your website either on [Streamlit cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or [Huggingface spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). Owned by Snowflake, a popular data warehouse company\n",
    "    - [Gradio](https://gradio.app/): Popular for image based applications and your website can be freely hosted on [Huggingface spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). Owned by Huggingface, the godfather of NLP models.\n",
    "    - [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/): Plotly is a hugely popular plotting library in Python. Dash is their open source dashboarding library. Very powerful but has a learning curve. In my opinion, Dash is probably the tool you want to use if you're selling the tool to others as it can build very high quality websites. But there is no option to host the website for free.\n",
    "- We'll use Streamlit to build a simple UI for the model we deployed to GCP Cloud Run and host this UI on Streamlit cloud.\n",
    "- ***IMPORTANT!*** We need the GCP Cloud Run API URL from `mlops-3-docker.ipynb` notebook to proceed"
