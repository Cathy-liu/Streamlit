wallstreetbet,"How sanctions against Russia will affect $TELLSome say war is bad for business but in this case not for $TELL at least.

Annalena Baerbock, German foreign minister, told that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would supply natural gas from Russia to Germany, was included in the sanctions package and the US state department said that Nord Stream 2 would ‚Äúnot move forward‚Äù if Russia invaded Ukraine.

Europe‚Äôs willingness to target Russia‚Äôs vast hydrocarbons industry could affect European companies including BP, Total and Shell, which invest in the Russian gas sector. Russia is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of oil and gas, but its energy sector relies on joint ventures with foreign companies as well as international technology and expertise.

Last year Shell signed a five-year ‚Äústrategic co-operation‚Äù agreement with Gazprom, having already worked with the company on the development of LNG projects in Russia‚Äôs far east. This agreement is definitely getting shelved in the event of war.

This means that Europe needs new suppliers, which can accelerate the funding process of Tellurian‚Äôs LNG project. 

Tellurian is going to start construction with or without FID in april (ground preparations work). You may ask where they get their bread from to start construction? Simple, from their gas well in Louisiana.

Side note for you bozo‚Äôs: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) adopted new criteria they will use to grant approval for gas facilities and pipelines. The criteria is more stringent and includes carbon emissions and impacts on communities. 

But for $TELL it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem since the their facility and Driftwood pipeline were already approved. The Line 200/300 pipeline DOESN'T have FERC approval yet, but the pipeline runs along an existing pipeline and has a reduced carbon footprint so impacts to the community and carbon emissions shouldn't prevent it from getting approval under the new criteria. 

Worst case scenario the FERC approval is delayed which is not a huge issue. Phase 1 (11mt/year) of Driftwood needs 1.5bcf/day of gas feed and the full 27.6mt/year facility needs 4bcf/day of feed. The Driftwood Pipeline that is already approved can accommodate 4bcf/day so that pipeline is more than enough for now and could cover the full needs until Line 200/300 is approved (if it's delayed). [possible explanation why the prices dipped last friday]


So basically Tellurian is a great bet but be carefull don‚Äôt expose yourself to much.

This is not financial advice. Do your own DD.

wallstreetbet,"Initial futures market open thoughts 2/20/22https://www.tradingview.com/x/agNnObaR

my initial thoughts seeing the futures pop on the ""good news."" 
1. its not really good news... all that was said was that IF he doesnt invade come Thursday they will have a summit to talk... doesnt mean he isnt gonna before then. also i dont like these fake pumps based on news. generally i feel they just cause a bulltrap. just look at the FOMC and russia news friday. 
2. we saw crypt0 bleed all weekend and that to me is the overall market sentiment. 
3. futures are open for a weird time frame. tonight till 1pm tomorrow. then reopens at 6pm for normal. that could effect stuff. i also anticipate that this news is going to be well digested by market open Tuesdays. just look back at the green futures and pre market friday that went red all day. 
4. the bigger issue here is still inflation not war. this is a distraction in my opinion and it doesnt negate whats coming in march.

supports to watch (for es)- 4358 --&gt; 4444 --&gt; 4332 --&gt; 4320.
Resistance- 4377 (failed to even reach this on the initial good news pop) --&gt; 4400. 

Candles trending back below the 8 ema... very well could see this pop just slow bleed. 

i will be watching this closely but i wouldnt be surprised by Tuesday morning market open to see us flat or red again‚Äã.

Tuesday morning before i go to sleep i will post a detailed pre market analysis"

wallstreetbet,"Why you should buy puts on Canon stockThe need for cameras has been going down over the last decade or so and so has Canon's yearly revenue. Because of how advanced modern phone cameras are it will prevent Canon and it already has, from selling there products to a wider range of clients. Obviously cameras are not the only product that they sell, but they control 45% of the camera industry which is bigger than Sony, nikon, and fuji combined. This is not as important as it seems because total share of the market means nothing because you need to compare it to a companies market cap to get a more accurate idea of how heavily invested they are in a product or sector. The thing that is troubling for me when looking at the stock is the history of revenue and how it has been going down in the last decade or so. A company like Canon, that controls such a large share in the camera sector, having a dwindling revenue is a good indicator that the whole camera market is and will continue to be on a decline. Here is the annual revenue, in millions, for Canon from 2010 until 2020
2020 $29,706
2019 $33,058
2018 $35,963
2017 $36,312
2016 $31,294
2015 $35,409
2014 $35,409
2013 $38,433
2012 $43,497
2011 $45,608
2010 $45,764

The revenue has been trending downwars ever since the year 2011. There was an event in 2010 that had a major effect on the whole entire camera sector. The release of the iPhone 4. All the previous models of the iPhone did have cameras and built apples name up but what came out on the iPhone 4 was what eliminated part of the need for a camera for many people. The addition of a front facing camera made it easy for people to take selfies and record themselves instead of using a camcorder or other type of camera. With almost all new phones implementing front facing cameras and upgrading the specs on the front and back facing cameras, it almost entirely removed the need for a physical camera for the average person when taking photos. With the prices of modern iphones increasing to close to and above $1000, it made it impractical to carry around or use a high-end camera that would cost the same amount as a brand new phone that could already fulfill the users needs.

Since Canon's revenue has been going down so much and with the need for cameras going down it is obvious that the price of a Canon share will continue to go down if nothing major happens to the camera industry. The best bet for this IMHO would be longterm puts that would be eventually exercised in two to three years that would not be effected by short term news that might make Canon rise a few percent at once.

wallstreetbet,"BYND is looking tasty. Buy &gt;6 months out, ~20% OTM.Bois,

So I did some DD and this is my theory:

No one is holding BYND anymore, there is a 40% shortfloat, last results were terrible. It was pumped and dumped hard.

But here we are, no one likes fake burgers. Analysts have low expectations and its not getting mentioned on here at all anymore. Its oversold at almost any timeframe and its going down for weeks.   

The setup is simple: If they beat, they will rise 20% or so within a few days. This is where you sell 50%. It has some meme value and more importantly: its a company we kind of need in our current world. They have some nice partnerships going on and will easily get more: Its green so brands want to connect their name to it, hence why there are things like a McPlant now. Food will become a hot topic this year due to many failed harvests. So its a nice play for the next months too. Sell your other 50% in a few steps. If we have some good momentum this week, it can run up 20% in a day on good results. 

If they dont beat but dont miss bigly: Shorts will probably close soon. Enough profit is made and there is risk keeping shorts open due to being technically oversold.

If they miss: Its expected by now with BYND, and very much priced in. Only real risk if sentiment is bad due to WW3 the day of earnings. 

What is the bearcase?
They cant make money and people have a instinctive problem with fake meat. Compare it with Tesla many years ago when no one took EV's serious, some people are against it by default. That is also what you see when you look at reviews, most are very biased one side or the other. In time, this will get less and less. 

So buy calls 20% out of the money, at least 6 months out, so I can be wrong here (I am not) and you wont lose all your money.

Adios Amigos


tl;dr: Fake meat is low, buy now and sell high. 

Disclaimer: I never consumed a product of BYND, and not planning to."

wallstreetbet,"How to stomach losses (realized/unrealized)?Hi degens,

My portfolio has taken a big hit since November 2021 and I'm down **more than** $180k (between realized and unrealized losses). I feel really bad about it and hate myself for putting myself through this. I could have stuck to bluechips or indexes and come out much ahead but I chose to get into growth stocks in November after which they have been on a constant downfall (cue the ""it fell because you bought"" comments) - think ROKU, PYPL etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels worse because beginning of 2021 was such a great time for me (till mid-Feb), was making all the right calls day trading and making a ton of money. Lately I'm seeing a few friends buy houses, cars, splurging on stuff and I feel terrible about not being able to do so. When others were buying all that I was putting my $ in the market in the hopes that I will be able to make bigger purchases later (not for bragging but just what I like), now all that is down the drain. I feel like a loser. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Apple - last year when Apple announced removing the ability for companies to track users, I knew Facebook would drop. Cross app advertising was their cash cow. All due to apple needing more revenue streams. So, advertising is another behemoth apple will try to gain at the expense of other companies (just like music and Spotify etc) (also, apple will definitely one day be broken up - but that‚Äôs another topic) this will damage facebooks money printer.

2. TikTok - user base is slowly being eaten up.  Without the power of ads to attract apps to use you as a login, you lose customers and lose users as well.

Ok so what? Game theory time.

Meta verse. Why the rebrand? Meta can‚Äôt lose their own strategic moat USERs to other new apps while letting apple/google etc introduce a new device for meta verse applications. Because those meta apps require users and a social network. And with TikTok gaining in users and networks, Facebook‚Äôs edge in partnership with apple or Facebook is in decline. 

So the only move Facebook has is build there own devices and brand as a meta verse company first. 

From a game theory pov this is perfect chess move.

What to watch for? Oculus and other VR/AR adoption. If we see those adoptions double every quarter or year and they‚Äôre driven by Facebook user base, Meta is a huge buy. This is because it‚Äôs a huge signal in that direction.

They‚Äôll own there own destiny. They‚Äôll print not only in ad revenue but in applications.

Tbh, Facebook should have built a phone or bought blackberry or partnered with a phone maker back in 2010ish. Game theory at the time shows that that‚Äôs what they should have done.

Disclosure: I own no meta but waiting to see oculus adoption over a few quarters"

Financial commentary is the bane of retail investors.

wallstreetbet,"ESTC - Elastic - Strong financials and settled a lawsuit with AmazonI've been in and out of this trade since 2019. In 2019, elastic sued Amazon for trademark infringement. They settled last week on ""undisclosed terms"". Elastic also had a major management change a couple weeks ago which caused a massive one day price drop. Shay Bannon, the founder and former CEO dropped to Chief Technology Officer and a new CEO was brought in. Earnings are being announced a bit later than expected on March 3. During the announcement of the change of CEO, Shay Bannon already said that they will beat on revenue and earnings:

[https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-promotes-ashutosh-kulkarni-to-ceo](https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-promotes-ashutosh-kulkarni-to-ceo)

No competitors other than Splunk the dinosaur and the companies who have forked elasticsearch. I'm a software engineer. My company uses elasticsearch. There's no chance we would use a fork of elasticsearch because of the potential for it to get abandoned.

I think they are going to do well on earnings, but I predict the big news here will be a new partnership with Amazon. The CEO change and the lawsuit settlement (which, if taken to court would have resulted in a victory for elastic) occuring so close together combined with a slightly delayed earnings announcement leads me to believe that something big will be announced during the earnings call. Combined with 43% YoY revenue growth and a P/S of only around 9-10, this is a slam dunk earnings play.

wallstreetbet,"META is the future. Why META is foreverYou read the title, now you have come for the post. Good Boy. I wrote this with a crayon so stick with me.

For those of you who live under a bridge, Meta is a company formerly known as Facebook who was also formally the 6th biggest company by market cap but recently fallen out of the top 10. 

**IS THAT A DIP I hear?**

That depends on your personal view of Facebook, will it be able to transition, or is this the fall of the Zuck, especially since Apple has taken a stance against Meta and Google will do so in 2023. However, you are forgetting one key factor. 

Doing some analysis of companies that have failed throughout history like Enron, Blockbuster, Toys R Us, and Blackberry's mobile department (huge fumble). They all had one thing in common. They were run by Humans. Humans come in different varieties physically and mentally resulting in volatility. Worse yet, humans don't just vary on a person by person basis but the same person varies depending on their emotions and age. Simply put, Humans are unstable and the reason why volatility exists. 

Now, Zuck, is a different breed, the man is cold like a machine because he is a machine. A machine with a vast amount of resources farming human data leading one of the biggest companies with an iron fist. The man even said he "" **comes across as robotic""** and "" **I've had a very hard time expressing myself**"". 

Now the question I want you to ask yourself. Do you want your company run by a human? considering that you are also human and are deep in the hole to someone or do you want the Zuck, with an army armed with Billions to transition? Knowing that he will outlive us all.

wallstreetbet,"Massive Credit Suisse leak reportedly reveals possible criminal ties among 18,000 accountsCredit Suisse was scrambling Sunday to contain the fallout from its latest scandal after several newspapers reported that more than 18,000 leaked accounts showed that criminals, alleged human rights abusers and sanctioned individuals including dictators had been clients of the Swiss bank.

The leaked information, which covered accounts holding more than $100 billion, came from a whistle-blower who shared his findings with German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, according to a press release. The newspaper then involved an anti-corruption group and 46 other media outlets around the world, including The New York Times, Guardian, Le Monde and others.


Clients of the second-biggest Swiss bank included an international cast of unsavory characters, according to the media reports. Account holders included a Yemeni spy chief implicated in torture, Venezuelan officials involved in a corruption scandal, and the sons of former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak.

The accounts had been opened from the 1940s into the 2010s, according to the Sunday release from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.

I'm bullish on sleep apnea stocks. Over a billion people have sleep apnea worldwide, it goes undiagnosed in 80% of cases, and increases the risk of the leading causes of death such as heart attack, stroke, cancer, accidents, and diabetes. I personally believe this sector will do well as millennials age and awareness increases on social media. The sleep apnea devices market is expected to have a [CAGR of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sleep-apnea-devices-market-size-worth-6-1-billion-by-2028-cagr-6-2-grand-view-research-inc-1030292947). Resmed is the world‚Äôs top CPAP manufacturer. CPAPs are the most effective treatment for sleep apnea.

Resmed (RMD) is my number one holding in my portfolio. I think they have a decent chance of growing to be as large as a company like Eli Lilly within the next 10-20 years. It all depends on whether or not the US Government decides to pursue a mass screening approach for sleep apnea. This is currently being debated in the [US Preventative Services Task Force](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-update-summary/obstructive-sleep-apnea-adults-screening).

My mid cap holdings:

1. Resmed (RMD).
2. Koninklijke Phillips (PHG). Also a CPAP manufacturer.

My higher risk growth plays are below:

1. Inspire Medical (INSP). They created an implant for sleep apnea, analogous to a pacemaker, to keep airways open at night. I think they have a good shot long term.
2. LivaNova (LIVN). UK equivalent of Inspire Medical, but their business is more diversified.
3. Sleep Number (SNBR). There‚Äôs some press that the company will develop more sleep tech to help with sleep apnea. My hope is that the company tries to acquire some other small cap sleep apnea companies out there to have a more integrated sleep solution.

I own all these companies with Resmed and Inspire being the bulk of my portfolio. I‚Äôm bullish on the space, but recognize that some of the small caps could have issues if not out right bankruptcies.

Henro fam. Lurker and noob here. I somehow was not able to post to r/stocks so I¬¥ll try my luck here :)

I would like to buy stocks for Bandai Namco and Kadokawa via Degiro from the EU.

My priority is for Kadokawa but the interface keeps telling me that I¬¥m not meeting the requirement of a minimum of a 100 shares. Which exceeds the amount I¬¥m willing to invest as a beginner. Is that a Degiro specific requirement and would i be able to buy a smaller amount via a different trader in the EU?

As for Bamco, I placed a ""Good until canceled"" Limit order slightly above the current market price. And it has not gone through, although market price is still well below my threshold. The available volume is miniscule so I¬¥m guessing there are no stocks up for sale?

Also, Kadokawa is shown as split in Trading View and should be available via TSE in Japan and OTC in the US (which I¬¥d prefer since there are no tx fees fur US trades on Degiro.) But the US branch does neither show up in Degiro nor does it move in Trading View.

I¬¥d appreciate any help on this.."

Long term Problems with Amazon, Facebook and Netflix:

Amazon:

Their prince Bezos is chilling with his girl friend in palace while their engineers are expected to work crazy hours, insist on highest standards and demonstrate great ownership. No great engineers want to work for a leader preaching vision from his hot tub. 

They had first mover advantage in cloud but now there are bunch of small and big players catching up with innovative &amp; reliable web services since cloud is not rocket science. 

They are doing well in online shopping but margins are not great because it‚Äôs less tech and more labor management &amp; customer service, which can‚Äôt scale as fast as pure labor free well written non rushed software (Google search, Microsoft office products, gmail, YouTube, Maps, etc)

Also majority of online shopping is third party marketplace who are always scared of cheap knock offs driven by fake reviews and Amazon basics so I don‚Äôt think growth there is sustainable. 

Facebook:

Just set of dying apps. We all know that no one really spends that much time on Facebook, Instagram, messenger &amp; whatsapp. They might have daily active users but those daily active users don‚Äôt really spend more than few mins on the app. Most of the communities and groups in these social media apps are ghost towns. They don‚Äôt rally own any mobile or desktop platform.

All the talk about meta verse is just the talks. It‚Äôs basically multi player real time game with VR which is not very new. Games (MetaVerse) can do well but it can also easily be very boring.

Netflix:

Yet another streaming app with all content being more than 30 mins. Even if they come up with great content, No one really has attention span of more than 10 mins these days. Netflix also hasn‚Äôt even developed a proper search engine in these many years. I watch more content on YouTube and TikTok than all streaming apps combined. No wonder YouTube revenue is similar to Netflix.

What‚Äôs the common problem with Amazon, Facebook and Netflix?

They are all tech companies with fear based culture. Engineers are always on their toes cutting corners to meet deadlines for next quarter so they don‚Äôt get fired in next performance cycle. So they never take long term risk or invest in big bets because big failure is not an option. Because they cut corners they also accumulate technical debt over time so basically talented engineers eventually spend more time keeping the lights on rather than innovating on new projects. 

Facebook and Netflix hire the top most tech talent and they have no rule rule. But none of their engineers ever came up with disruptive new tech and they are still basically a streaming app after so many years. Facebook similarly had to acquire innovations (Instagram, WhatsApp) because their engineers are too scared to get fired to innovate. 

I am also not long on Nvidia, AMD and all other companies whose products are not diversified.

Why am I long only ATM?

wallstreetbet,"The ""ultimate trailer"" for interest rate hikes will be released soon? Which asset class stocks can be the first to break out?Many industry insiders say the Fed may be expected to signal plans to raise interest rates in March at this week's rate meeting, which would be the first time the Fed has tightened monetary policy since it cut rates to near-zero levels following the outbreak of the epidemic.

There are also market views that the recent decline in U.S. stocks is a game between the long and short sides over the valuation of U.S. stocks due to the impending adjustment of benchmark interest rates, and that Powell will act as the ultimate 'referee' tonight.

As the Fed's attitude turns hawkish, the conditions for rate hikes and tapering become more and more ripe, and the direction of monetary contraction becomes clearer, global risk assets are repricing this.

Since the start of 2022, the technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen nearly 12% year-to-date, the worst January since 1972, with Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Tesla all down more than 10%.

With risk aversion in the market, meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC, which previously traded heavily, have weakened. In an analysis of data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith, the Investor's Business Daily said the total market capitalization of a basket of meme stocks has cumulatively evaporated by about $177 billion in just the past four weeks, with share prices falling by an average of 25 percent in a month.

Against the backdrop of an approaching Fed rate hike, the market is reassessing bets on those risky assets, namely unprofitable tech stocks that previously accompanied U.S. stocks all the way to the top, and startups that quickly went public through mergers with blank check companies (SPACs).

Some familiar companies in Silicon Valley, such as new media giant $Buzzfeed ([BZFD.US](https://BZFD.US))$, shared office giant $WeWork ([WE.US](https://WE.US))$, and Southeast Asian local lifestyle giant $Grab Holdings ([GRAB.US](https://GRAB.US))$, have also been hit hard in the recent U.S. stock selloff, with serious market capitalization evaporation.

It is worth mentioning that $Digital World Acquisition Corp ([DWAC.US](https://DWAC.US))$, which will merge with Trump's media company, is currently the best-performing SPAC stock, with a cumulative gain of more than 34% so far this year, according to SPAC Research. As of Wednesday's close, DWAC closed at $68.98, well above its initial IPO price of $10.

According to the agency, there are now 114 SPAC stocks on the U.S. stock market that have announced merger deals but have not yet completed them, and DWAC is one of them, and its stock price has raised the average price of all 114 stocks. If DWAC is excluded, the average price is $9.88 per share.

In fact, while most SPAC companies have underperformed financially, DWAC has been courted by Trump supporters and individual investors, and its share price performance has been particularly notable.

According to Shenwan Hongyuan in a research note, in fact, the expected selling pressure on the U.S. tech giant may be nearing an end. According to the data analysis of the past 5 times when technology stocks fell due to rising debt interest rates, the average drop of technology giants was 18%, while the drop of technology giants from December was close to 15%, so the decline is believed to be nearing its end.

Investment strategy, if investors can withstand the adverse impact of price pressure, should consider long-term bets on quality technology companies. It is recommended that investors pay attention to the fourth quarter results while paying attention to the company's published earnings guidance, in order to look at the end of the technology companies with high earnings growth potential.

This year is a year of intertwined macro factors, the market fluctuates repeatedly in the time gap between policy and fundamentals, too optimistic or too pessimistic strategy may not have a high winning rate. In the face of opportunities and challenges in 2022, it may be possible to be more optimistic when the market is down and more cautious when it is up."

As all you know, the inflaction is hitting hard recently, but, year after year, it increases the price of the products.
So, what about buying a portfolio of options, for example commodities, with leverage? (Of course splitting my money into severa commodities) lThis means that when the prices gets higher, I should gain way more than inflaction every time. Isn't it correct?"

wallstreetbet,"Weed Run Is ComingI wrote about this a few days ago and I believe this adds to the thesis. Legalization is a bi-partisan issue and we see this with republicans introducing legalization. Also, mega corporations like Amazon are supporting it. We know there are many acts sitting in congress right now including the MORE act and the SAFE act. 

Financial institutions being able to work with cannabis companies is going to create MASSIVE moves in some of these cannabis companies. This is close to, if not the bottom for weed. With inflation rising, cannabis is a tax revenue opportunity for the government and both sides see that. 

I think Tilray and Curaleaf will be the two largest movers. Tilray‚Äôs diversification is unmatched imo and a diverse product line in a new sector creates the most opportunity for success. Curaleaf seems to be the most established US company so it‚Äôs a great addition to hedge Tilray if the ‚Äúonly American companies will make it theory‚Äù works out. In my opinion, it won‚Äôt.

wallstreetbet,"EVERYONE IS OUT TO FUCK YOU, ESPECIALLY YOUR ""BROKER""I hope the newbies here come across this post because OHMYGOD I lost so much money to these ""brokers"" just off the spreads. These brokers charge spreads of up to $4 on the NASDAQ. Leveraged 100x (which they have in certain parts), buying one single contract of the NASDAQ nets you a -$400+ loss instantly, regardless of how right or wrong you are. Imagine this instead with a $20 commission. You start off a trade with a guaranteed loss of $20 only instead of -$400. High spreads kill.

THESE ARE NOT YOUR BROKERS

When you buy, IQ options sells you the asset. They are your counterparty. A normal broker by definition merely acts as your messenger, they connect you with a seller on the other side of the world, making a tiny cut of the size of your deal, they DO NOT ACT AS YOUR COUNTERPARTY ie. THEY MAKE THE SAME WHETHER YOU LOSE OR WIN. IQ Options acts as the messenger AND the counterparty ie.THEY WANT YOU TO LOSE SO THEY CAN MAKE MONEY. You buy a $1 worth asset at $1.03. They make that 0.03 spread because they are in a position to charge you that extra bit of money since you're stupid and use their services. Stock rises from $1 to $2. You make 1-0.03= +$0.97. Stock goes from $1 to $0. You lose 1+0.03= -$1.03. Notice with the same price delta, you will lose more and win less. So say you win once and lose once. You have won 0.97 and lost 1.03. You just netted negative with the same price delta. Conflict of interest much??? Isn't it thus their entire business to make you lose? Provide unstable connections? Most traders lose money anyway, therefore they make money by doing the opposite of what everyone does. But this conflict of interest is so damn fishy!

LACK OF VERIFICATION

I'm 16. It is illegal for me to trade, therefore I went to IQ Options as you can trade without verification and only need to fulfill KYC requirements when you withdraw. RED FLAG?? 15 YEAR OLD ME??? They do this as it's an incentive for stupid new people like me to go in and lose real money to them.

SIMPLE INTERFACE

Their interface is so simple, instead of CALL they use BUY, and instead of PUT they use sell. It is made for people with less than 5 minutes of education about Options to trade with, that is their customer base.

BINARY OPTIONS

What separates trading from gambling? Money management, and money management only! The fact that you can set SL and TP levels is pretty much the only thing that separates the markets from a Poker table. At worst you press buy and sell and the chances are 50/50. With even just 1.0001/1 TP/SL ratio. You stand to win money. This is smart gambling. With binary options, you stand to win $0.87 and lose $1. That means the chances of you getting your bet right and wrong HAS to be more than 50% just for you to BREAK EVEN!!! And with only a buy and sell button and random chart fluctuations. AT BEST!!! Your chances are 50% at winning. You will make CONSISTENT profits off binary options when pigs fly or when Cramer is right about a stock signal.

TLDR: These guys are out to fuck you, HARD!!! I use Tradovate. $0.25 spreads on NASDAQ 100 futures. They do indeed act as your counterparty but they do not make money when you lose because when you buy an asset, they sell it to you, but buy it from a liquidity provider (imagine someone that is willing to buy and sell you an asset at any time). Thus, if you make money, they lose money to you but make it back from the liquidity provider. The liquidity provider is the one who loses, but their entire business model lies on the fact that most traders lose money. Tradovate hedges, so when you win they win (no conflict of interest). Relatively low commissions and verification that means they are legit. JUST DONT USE IQ OPTIONS!! PLEASE!!"

wallstreetbet,"Morning Report | Fed Rate Resolution Coming; Bank of America: It's Too Early to Buy Tech StocksHot News

Fed Expected to Reveal Rate Hike in March Tonight; Will Powell 'Pamper' Stocks?

Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to hint at this week's meeting that it is prepared to raise interest rates as early as March, reversing the accommodative policies it has implemented to fight the epidemic. The Fed begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday and will issue a new statement tonight showing its determination to fight inflation. Against the backdrop of a sharp pullback in the stock market, Fed officials are expected to say they are prepared to raise the federal funds rate from zero as early as March. Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short-term interest rate strategy at Bank of America, said, ""We don't expect the Fed's stance to be moderate."" ""The bond market seems to be reacting to the stock market decline as well as geopolitical tensions, so perhaps the Fed doesn't sound as tough as it would in other circumstances. But we don't think the Fed will come out and tell the markets that four rate hikes this year are mispriced.""

Another step in Biden's oil price crackdown: U.S. announces second largest strategic oil reserve swap in history

On Tuesday, January 25 EST, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a combined exchange of nearly 13.4 million barrels of Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) with seven companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Phillips 66. This is the second largest short-term exchange of strategic oil reserves in U.S. history. In addition to the 13.4 million barrel short-term exchange announced on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy also launched a 32 million barrel oil reserve tender sale late last year. So far, Biden's 50 million barrels of strategic oil reserves release plan completed nearly 40 million barrels of release.

UBS: Maintains S&amp;P 500 price target of 5,100 at end of 2022

Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a report published after Monday's dramatic market shakeout that the poor (financial) performance of some of last year's 'stay-at-home' big winners has not eased market insecurity. He noted that short-term market direction is likely to remain unstable, with some key market factors still in flux, including the brewing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the continued rollout of corporate earnings reports and performance guidance. 'But for longer-term investors, we don't see this as a bad thing if market volatility cools the more speculative markets,' Haefele said. He believes we remain in a very strong economic growth environment, which should continue to support both cyclical and value-oriented sectors in the near term. He will maintain his target price of 5,100 for the S&amp;P 500 at the end of 2022.

Citi: U.S. Stock Market Selling Like a Trend or Sentiment Expression

Citi said investors' positions in the Nasdaq 100 have led to a situation that could trigger a short-term rally. The selling across the market is ""more like a trend or sentiment,"" analyst Chris Montagu said. He added that positions in Nasdaq futures ""are one-sided short and profit levels are rising rapidly, potentially leading to a short-term rally"" Despite this, the overall picture of futures flows ""remains one of continued weakness and lack of conviction.

Bank of America: It's too early to buy tech stocks against a backdrop of valuation and interest rate risk

While technology stocks have already been under heavy selling pressure this year, Bank of America said the situation could deteriorate further. ""It may be too early to buy a lot of technology stocks,"" analyst Savita Subramanian wrote. She noted that the information technology and communications services sector is crowded, expensive and ""in many cases vulnerable to interest rate risk."" Bank of America also listed a number of stocks it considers attractive, including Applied Materials, Broadcom and Cisco.

U.S. government predicts global chip shortage will continue until the end of the year, admits it is still very early to get out of the woods

The Biden administration has concluded that the global semiconductor shortage will continue at least through the second half of this year, which will put long-term pressure on many U.S. companies, including automakers and the consumer electronics industry. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Tuesday that U.S. officials plan to investigate allegations of price fraud in chips used by auto and medical device makers. Discussing the Commerce Department's industry findings with reporters, she said, ""We're still quite a ways away from getting out of the woods as it relates to semiconductor supply issues."" Raimondo said the median inventory dropped from 40 days to less than five days, ""a figure that to me shows how fragile the supply chain is: there's only enough inventory for five days and no room for error.

wallstreetbet,"Will the Fed really drag down US stocks?Where will US stocks go?

The situation in Russia and Ukraine disturbed the market and superimposed people's expectations of the Fed's interest rate hike cycle in March. US stocks were sold off on Monday, but finally walked out of the deep V-shape. On the same day, the three major stock indexes of US stocks fell sharply during the session. The Dow once fell by more than 3% and more than 1115 points, the NASDAQ once fell by nearly 5%, and the S &amp; P 500 index once fell by nearly 4%. However, the three major stock indexes recovered their decline and finally closed up slightly.

Despite the turmoil in the US stock market and the downturn in fundamental data, the interest rate market still firmly believes that the Fed will not suspend the tightening policy, and the interest rate hike in March is imminent. The swap market shows that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates by 25 basis points in March, and the market expects to raise interest rates by nearly one full percentage point in 2022. At 3 a.m. Beijing time on Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce the interest rate resolution, and the market will pay attention to whether the bank will disclose signals on raising interest rates and shrinking the table.

The Fed's interest rate hike is a certainty, but what impact will it have on the trend of US stocks? Strategists have different opinions.

Brian Rauscher, head of Fundstrat Global Advisor global portfolio strategy and asset allocation division, said its research shows that trading lows may have emerged, but considering that the Federal Reserve, inflation peaked and COVID-19 have not yet ended, the strategist is not sure whether the low point in the first half has reached. Therefore, radical traders and strategic investors have the opportunity to take advantage of the expected rebound to find high-quality stocks that have been over sold.

In contrast, Marko kolanovic, chief equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, has a clearer view. Kolanovic believes that investors' concerns about rising interest rates have gone too far, and the correction of the S &amp; P 500 index may be approaching the ""final stage"". He said that the bearish sentiment in the stock market is inconsistent with the momentum of economic activity, the bottleneck of the supply chain has eased, and ""we expect a strong earnings season"".

Kolanovic said that the decline in investor sentiment and oversold technical indicators showed that ""we may be in the final stage of this adjustment. Although the market is still trying to absorb the rotation caused by the interest rate increase, we expect the earnings season to restore market confidence"".

Kolanovic believes that if the stock market continues to fall, the Fed may change its policy to prevent the decline. ""In the worst case, we may see the return of the Fed put option."" It is reported that the so-called fed put option means that if the US stock market falls sharply due to the tightening of monetary policy, the Fed will stop tightening.

If the Fed adjusts its policy because of the sharp decline in the stock market, it may mean that the number of interest rate hikes this year will be reduced or the plan to reduce its balance sheet will be postponed. This, in turn, could help drive the return of investors' risk appetite and trigger a rebound in hard hit technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. But all this may depend on the rate of inflation.

Julian Emanuel, strategist at evercore is, said on Monday that the date when the S &amp; P 500 index fell to 3670 was the date when the Federal Reserve put option was exercised. Emanuel said that by reviewing the past events, such as the 1987 stock market crash, the 1988 long term capital management (LTCM) private equity fund collapse, the 2001 technology bubble burst, the 2008 global financial crisis, 2019 Powell transformation (Powell Pivot), 2020 in response to the epidemic relief, etc. The average strike price of the Federal Reserve put option is expected to fall 23.8% from peak to trough (equivalent to the current S &amp; P 500 index falling to 3670 points).

Matt Maley, chief market strategist of Miller Tabak + company, observed that although there are signs of ""forced liquidation"" such as margin recovery, the leverage accumulated in the past few years will take longer to be lifted. Therefore, Maley believes that this is a time for investors to sell at high rather than buy at low.

There are many bearish voices in the market. Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at stifel, an investment bank, said that the rally of the S &amp; P 500 index that stopped falling and rebounded on Monday was a complete fraud. The strategist said that in order to make the stock market fall to a low point and restart the bull market, many things need to be done, including the shift of the policy doves of the Federal Reserve to lower the yield of the US ten-year inflation protected treasury bonds (TIPS) (the real yield of US Treasury bonds) and the bottom of the US manufacturing PMI, but these are unlikely to happen.

Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at Wharton Business School, also believes that the ""shock"" period of the US stock market is far from over. The NASDAQ index dominated by technology stocks is bound to fall into a bear market, and the S &amp; P 500 index will also fall into a correction, that is, 10% lower than the recent high. The index once reached this decline on Monday. In terms of inflation, Siegel believes that the inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy will continue for a whole year, and prices may rise by another 7% as in 2021.

Therefore, Siegel said that this series of technical signals also indicate that the market may be more volatile. The US market will face more fundamental challenges in the future, from the Fed's difficult to curb price pressure to the continuous spread of the Omicron variant virus, which will weaken the economic expansion in the first quarter."

wallstreetbet,"$WISH will uno reverse very shortly.All the steps are in place for a turnaround this year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a CEO replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so many people if you are not planning on growing. Why is the replacement of the CEO important? Because it means changes are coming :
""if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already
agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish."" To me is very strange to see $WISH CEO steps down so easily, he
seems someone that would fight until the end and we saw that on the past.. For that reason I think that we would have a buyout coming. So let's put pieces
together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track of a potentail buyout opportunity or a great future growth.

Key facts

-4th highest app usage in USA behind Amzn, Walmart, eBay

-new Australian office run by ex Silicon Valley exec

-Wish Local = mini fulfillment centers at no cost. 

Same day p/u -Wish Express (5 days or less ship) available

-Wish Access ($5.99 unlimited ship) being rolled out

-**Wish Parcel = discounted logistics to small biz. 1B revenues** (I highly recommend you read into wish parcel. Very promising and a solid way to diversify revenue streams. 

- Deals W/PrestaShop (300k merchants), Cafe24 (1.9M merchants)

-Postal deals W/Spain (Carreos), China, USPS, Africa.

-BNPL buy now pay later at checkout as well as Applepay-650 new hires creating new departments and efficiency. 

-new Exec Chair running daily operations Jackie Reses (SQ, Yahoo, Baba, Affirm, Goldman) **smart lil slut**

-new CTO Google, eBay 10 years (ran Marketplace)

-new PO (Ads/SocialMedia) Google, Flipkart, Twitter, Bing

-5 out of 10 merchants are in USA and make up 1/3 sales

Biggest risk for me is cash burn. 1.2 billion with about a billion in cash burn over the trailing 12 months. Aggressive reduction in ad spending I believe with reflect favorably next earnings call. The bankruptcy/delisting argument is absurd. It just has too much going for it.

Sure, right now it matters for the poor people, but we never care about them anyway. They‚Äôre always fucked by our economy. 

For us fine middle/upper middle class folks, all we‚Äôre doing is reading a bunch of articles about devastating inflation, coming on Reddit to bitch about it, having a good disaster porn/financial collapse/apocalypse circle jerk‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and then going out to lunch and paying for our $18 sub. And lots of our kind-hearted employers are even giving us inflation adjustments for being good boys and girls.

wallstreetbet,NASDAQ 2022 chart Ai analysis
wallstreetbet,"SPY crash incomingWhat's up WSB.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the SPY has been irrational and no one truly knows what direction it's going to take except for maybe Nancy Pelosi. I present to you my very amateur technical analysis. Am I wrong? Probably. Are you reading this anyway? Yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, some of you are gonna call me crazy.  And you're probably right! Why do I think it's going to crash? Stay tuned and I'll tell you why.

&amp;#x200B;

My thesis here is based on the price action the last few days. The last time the price dipped below the 260 day moving average on the daily chart was during the crash of 2020 in March. You may be asking yourself ""But Harryp0thead, why the 260 Day MA?"". The answer to that is simple. There are 260 Business days in a year, therefore, it is the yearly moving average.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to my thesis.  [My first chart](https://imgur.com/dR5B4wa) shows the daily chart action. I traced over the 5 day MA of the 2020 crash and placed it over the current price action. Fits like a glove. Also shown are the 260 and 26 day moving averages. [My second chart](https://imgur.com/iz9rQxk) shows the 30 minute price action. Once again, the indicators fit like a glove. The March crash was bailed out by the fed printing money and we may finally be seeing the crash as it was meant to be.

&amp;#x200B;

If you look closely and we are to believe that the chart can/will behave the same way, we will be trading sideways to the end of January. Is it possible that we dip or rise before that? Of course it is! I believe this sideways trading is a bull trap before the market de-leverages and corrects from the fed going brrrrr for far too long.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I am of the belief that the price movement is going to depend on what the fed does in the coming days/weeks. Does the fed decide to continue printing money? SPY goes brrrrrrrrr. Does the fed decide to taper off and raise interest rates? Spy goes üåàüêª.

&amp;#x200B;

How far down will the SPY go if it crashes? Like I said, no one knows except for maybe Nancy Pelosi.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

SPY Goes üåàüêª if the fed raises interest rates and turns the printer off.

2. Russians and many Ukrainians actually want to be reunited as one nation they used to be, it's much stronger than any sanctions. They sent 20M men to die in WWII this covid bullshit and poor economy and political isolation is not going to stop them, and

wallstreetbet,"Spring - Wheat - RussiaSo here it is.
It‚Äôs spring soon.

Without a peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia in a week, I‚Äôm not sure where things will go, in a bad way. This is the time we need to pray. Because there will be no going back.

Why?

Wheat plant season starts. Without the bread basket of the world producing, unfortunately we will lose about a third of wheat.

This means nations that aren‚Äôt as affluent as ours will lose food. Our nations will begin to hoard and prices for everything wheat based will rise.

Not only wheat but corn and fertilizer.  Russia has begun as well to disrupt exports from Ukraine:  

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-war-russia-blocks-ships-carrying-grain-exports/a-61165985

I‚Äôm sad about this. What Russia has done has not only created these problems of killing innocent people, but now has set of a chain of events where the world food supply is at risk.

If the spring farming season is impacted, this will lead to a year or more of food supply impact.

Everything will begin to be inflated.

Some farms around the world have begun trimming acres from what they‚Äôve been farming because the cost of fertilizer.

Putin needs to make a deal asap. And stop this foolishness.

I‚Äôm afraid he won‚Äôt, this will lead to a 2nd to 3rd orders of effects in our economy.

Companies and nations will begin to vertically align their food supply chain. Russian people (not those fucking nationalist idiots happy for the killing of Ukrainians) will be poorer. Many have lost their jobs.

This is a slow nuclear bomb situation. Russia is completely done. Even if we get a deal we will start removing Russia.

So now we have the WSB portion:

Short term of course what I will get and have:

WEAT, USO, BOIL, MOS, VALE, URA

May get CORN, and some other uranium, nickel, oil, natural gas, fertilizer stocks.

Long term:

China stocks and economy are slowly going to go down.  We don‚Äôt want to deal with countries like this again, and calls will start to stop relying on these countries that can fuck us over.

GMO stocks. A buy in my opinion, since now food supply will need science to keep producing food.

Here's my thought:

Currently their are peace talks in Ukraine, these peace talks will either end two ways, Either:

A: Russia and Ukraine make peace, in which case the market rally's

or,

B: Ukraine and Russia become locked in the the same state they are now, thus, no change

If A happens the market will go up, If B happens I believe the market will also go up, as lots of the volatility of the market was generated from the confusion around Chinas response, and our supply lines. Now that these issues are resolved I believe over the next month the SMP has a really good chance of going up 5-10% offsetting the market correction that happened a month ago.

Part 2a: Squeezemetrics vix paper explainedI posted in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3kmaf/spliffmaster489s_crash_course_in_economics_and/) about market mechanics of the S&amp;P500.  I think with the recent rally in mind we should review [THIS SQUEEZE METRICS PAPER](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf) and talk about why we should look to btfd (buy the fucking dip) after these big down moves.  I'm going to go page by page and try to explain the concepts inside it.  Before you read this post you will need to have a firm knowledge on what the options greeks are and why they are important.  I will try to explain some concepts but I might gloss over others.  If you want to learn more watch [this video about options greeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXZIW161ryI).  

&amp;#x200B;

Page 1: 

The paragraph starting with ""options are best known for their non-linear payoff""

Despite what the moron 19 year olds on this sub think, options market makers just fill orders that come through.  THAT IS BASICALLY IT.  Now lets say you are a big dog manager at an options market maker firm and you have a big ass portfolio filled with millions of options contracts.  What are you going to do to limit your risk?  Of course you have to do something, you can't just keep taking the other side of trades and hope you make money.  The trick is to hedge your options by buying or selling the underlying stock to make your position ""neutral"".   This is where delta comes in.  Delta is how much your option will increase if the underlying increases.  For example, if you own a 440 SPY call with 50 deltas then your call will go up 50 dollars if SPY goes up 1 dollar.  Thus if we want to neutralize our position then we need to short 50 shares.  This is because if SPY goes up one dollar from 440 to 441 then we gain 50 dollars from the call.  However, we lose 50 dollars from our short 50 shares position.  Hence we neither gained nor lost any money during this move (it's more complicated than this be we will talk about gamma and vanna later).  A rule of thumb to keep in mind is that you need to short as many shares as you have deltas to be flat delta.   Puts have negative delta because if the underlying goes up in price then you lose money.  If you want to hedge a put then you buy shares until you have 0 delta.  This is what the market makers do to ensure that they have minimal risk.  Their massive options protfolios are a jumbled mess of all kinds of complex options orders with crazy deltas and they have algos buying and shorting shares as appropriate to ensure that they are delta flat.  THIS CONSTANT BUYING AND SELLING FROM ROBOTS IS WHAT CAN INFLUENCE THE MARKET.  I, of course, do not claim that some nefarious algo is out there trying to shake you out of your dog shit 400 SPY puts that just got blown the fuck out of the water.  I simply claim that these robots must hedge their positions by trading the underlying so that their portfolios can survive.  This type of hedging is called ""dynamic hedging"".

Page 2:

Now that we know how algos hedge their options the question is how do we make a profit off this knowledge.  Right now it doesn't seem that obvious but there are some reasonable assumptions that we can make to get the ball rolling.  The first comes from the fact that the options dealers' biggest customers are pension funds.  These funds need to protect their massive S&amp;P holdings so they will buy puts for protection.  They also want to make some extra money off of their assets so they will sell covered calls.  The options dealers are on the other side of this trade so they will be long calls and short puts.  

Now we need to start talking about gamma and it influences the algos' trading.  

Another way to think about delta is that it is roughly the probability that your option will be worth something at expiration.  So an at the money option should have a delta of about 50 because it is basically a coin toss on if it's going up or down.  However, if the market moves in a way that is favorable towards your position then the probability that your option will be in the money should be higher.  Hence the delta should also be higher.  This phenomena is gamma.  Gamma is the increase in the delta of your option when the underlying increases.  This is an issue for the market making algos because whenever the underlying moves they have to rehedge their position.  For example, if I buy a 50 delta call with 2 gamma then I will go short 50 shares to hedge.  Now the underlying goes up a dollar and I now have a 52 delta call (50 delta + 2 gamma) and I am short 50 shares.  I now need to short an additional 2 shares to stay neutral.  In this example we see that staying neutral is an active process that requires constant participation in the market.  

If you are still confused about how these options are hedged you can look at a more in depth explanation on page 3 of that squeeze metrics paper.  

In the next post I will explain how this active hedging impacts liquidity and influences the market."

wallstreetbet,"Norges Bank (NORWAY) - Potentially Something HUGE HereLook, I'm not hyperbolic like many schmoes on here. Heck, I'm the boring $DGX DD guy. **But something MASSIVE potentially just happened today involving Norges Bank (central bank of Norway).** I am 99% sure they divested from multiple (possibly all?) US stock holdings at the closing bell today. No, I don't know what this means....but I do know there is breaking news TODAY regarding a US military plane going down in NORWAY during ""planned"" NATO exercises. Maybe just a coincidence, but this divestiture is big news regardless of the cause anyway. 

For context, Norges Bank holds (or held) very substantial positions in multiple US staples. One of which is **Verizon $VZ** at $2 BILLION, making them one of the largest shareholders period. Another company is **Colgate $CL** where they were in for $700m. **Basically Norges owned 1% of both of these companies, which is certainly a material amount.** 

**So how did I figure all this out?** Keeping it as brief as possible so I don't spend my entire Friday night on WSB. In the last 5 minutes of trading today, $VZ volume went through the roof out of nowhere and the stock dropped an additional 2%. All happened in literally a few minutes. This isn't normal obviously. No one seemed to know who, why, or what caused it so I start looking for other companies with similar movement today. **I quickly notice Colgate had the exact same thing happen at the exact same time as Verizon.** Now I'm interested. This is two companies in entirely different spaces and both are relatively safe defensive dividend stocks with ZERO news on the day. 

So I go look at institutional filings for both $VZ and $CL. What do ya know? Norges Bank's previously listed shares tie practically perfectly to the abrupt volume spike for both Verizon and Colgate. Norges Bank divested entirely from enormous positions in these companies. **They did it suddenly and in a kneejerk move because no institution or fund would unwind positions of that size all at once.** You are guaranteed to take the largest loss possible doing this / hurt your value.  

They may have divested from multiple other companies as well, but I haven't had a chance to dive deeper. The question is why? Did they get underwater in another position? Margin called? Geopolitics? That's for WSB to decide."

Today was one of the highest quad witching days options expirations with over 3.5 Trillion worth of options set to expire. With that we, however, did not see an abnormal amount of volume traded reaching only 106.4 Million compared to the 10 day average of 116.5 million. 

Now that the quad witching day is over and the 2nd quarter is upon us we should see the big wigs reposition themselves for where they see the next quarter going. One thing I wanted to point out with this wild bull week we had is that the last quad witching (big wig rebalancing) was Decemeber 17th 2021 which if you remember back to December 2021 we were on the path to see ATH and we did before we feel from a high of 480 all the way down to 410 at the lows. There is some speculation that with the low volume this week and arguably many hedgefunds and big wigs caught on the wrong side of the rail road tracks that this was arbitrarily ran up this week to allow them to get out without suffering massive losses that many of them would have suffered with things expiring down in the 420s or lower. With that being said these big wigs are not allowed to reposition themselves for where they see this going over the next 4 months (June 17th). If they are still short and still see this going down we may actually see this bear market continue. However, if they are still see this going back to ATH and the bull run back on we will have our first hints of that come next week. 

Many people have been complaining and pointing out how ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù it has felt for SPY and other stocks to be going up the way they have on essentially no good news despite all the bad things with inflation, economy, rate hikes, etc. Even CNBC was explaining after the FOMC meeting that JPOW did not change his tone from hawkish to doveish (which is the way the market reacted these last 3 days) but he seemed even more hawkish than before. Watching the FOMC and press conference live with the PPI/ CPI data we have gotten of late there really is no reason we should have seen a 7% green move this week. Quite the opposite actually. Which does lead me back to where I believe this market moved unnaturally this week to allow big wigs to save some of their coin. If we see more red next week and we do not see a continuation of this bullish movement I do believe the bottom is not in. IF the bulls continue to come out swinging next week it is safe to say that 410 was the bottom and we should be repositioning ourselves (at least until April when we get new CPI and FOMC stuff) for the bull run. Monday and Tuesday will be very telling.

Despite opening down 0.7%, yet again another red open, SPY was able to find its bull legs again and pushed this all the way from 438 to a close at 444.52. SPY only closed +0.78%, however, saw 1.4% of bullish upward movement today. Looking at the intraday 15 minute char it is actually quite impressive yet again, that SPY managed to close today without a single FULL candle (or even candle body today) below the 8 ema for now the second day in a row. Watching the intraday breadth it was red (which indicates more sell than buy pressure) from open until about 1pm. Despite that SPY continued to climb which tells that there were some massive buy orders that came in that out weighed the smaller but large quantity sell orders. We saw a very similar pattern intraday yesterday also. I will be very interested to see where we go Monday.

https://preview.redd.it/ldjx83v7n8o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e19c13137b8f5636df124b2baac46c72020aa4ef

Intraday we did see quite the fight at 441, however, SPY managed to pop through to negate the potential double top I called out yesterday. Todays candle closed right under the daily 100 EMA of 445.1. We have still not seen a candle close above the daily 100 EMA if over 1.5 months. Todays trend did bring the daily 8 ema back above the daily 20 ema for the first time since January 13th (mind you any significant move down will adjust that below the 20 ema so this could be a false cross). The death cross is still only $2 away from occurring but the daily 50 EMA is now running parallel to the 200 EMA instead of directly at it. 

With the red channel above I see a resistance for Monday (if we are obeying the downward channel) of 446. Interstingly if we are in a bull channel using the current points we also have a high of 446 tomorrow and while its not perfect todays candle did technically reject the upper resistance of the green upward channel and failed to breakout. 

While my channels are important I focus more currently on the 100 EMA going into next week and whether SPY will be able to get a candle closed above that or not. IF we fall back below the 200 EMA of 438.12 next week I will take that as a big HINT at this being a failed breakout and will look for support around 420 otherwise we will be head back to 400. Despite all this bullish movement there really still is a very strong case for how SPY will test 400 before we see 460 again. Unfortunately we are just at a waiting game now. One thing to keep in mind is that the market markets KNOW everything we do, they know all the same points and levels and they also see every single buy order, sell order, option, stop loss, etc. They are smarter than we think they are. It would not surprise me if they knew moving SPY to this level would trigger enough people to go long on calls and close their puts that they could repush this low. Only time will tell unfortunately. But also some of the beauty of my strategy intraday trading is that it really doesn‚Äôt matter what the overall trend is (definitely helpful to know‚Ä¶) but we just trade the chart in front of us. 

https://preview.redd.it/4pfd4eb9n8o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b3cb4663a2bce80cfedac72cccb09864f399783

The weekly chart shows a similar picture that the daily does (I added a grey channel here from January 3rds high to todays high and using January 24ths weeks lows). The weekly chart also perfectly rejected at the weekly 20 ema of 445. This to me is another sign of a potential fake breakout. SPY had plenty of room to run today and plenty of green left (only finishing up 0.78%) yet it failed to break the key Daily 100 EMA and the key weekly 20 EMA resistance lines. We will have to see where Monday and Tuesday takes us next week but there like I said is still a very real case we could touch as low as the weekly 100 EMA  (402) or weekly 200 EMA (355) before we finally recover.

10% challenge- 

I was only able to trade full time 3 days this week as I was sick and with the kiddos for spring break. Overall my goal of the week was $2500 (which would be 10% for me per day) and I managed to lock in $1375 at the end of the day today. Some of the losses also came from experimenting with my new indicator also, which today I feel like I finally fine tuned and look forward to continuing to use next week. Despite only trading for about 2 hours at most today I locked in 7 trades (all green ranging from 3%-50%). 

I look forward to a new week next week and a new shot at the 10% challenge."

wallstreetbet,"GME FundamentalsReposting here to WSB just because I see a ton of FUD on my reddit after the latest GME ER. I am specifically talking numbers, not speculative ""things"", and to those who consider themselves investors and in particular newbies (traders you can ignore)... in hopes that it may educate you and perhaps calm you through the ebs and flows.

Although  we're living in a twilight-zone market right where fundamentals seem to  be an afterthought, they are still important, and I want to walk away  from other ""things"" for a moment and just talk about the earnings report  from a strictly numbers perspective.

As  a fundamental investor, cash flow is one of the more important things  to look at, it's part of the moat that WB talks about, and tells a great  story on how responsible the company is with your money.

Now, the reason why GME is down in part is because it's hemorrhaging cash and the 52 week cash flow shows:

* Net loss from operations  getting worse  

   * partially  because cost of sales widening and merchandise sales weren't all that  sexy (however, keep in mind cogs is relative to earnings which in this  case gross earnings not very good)
   * As an investor and in this environment I would to see this come down over time not up
* Net  loss from investments grew but in part only because they weren't  liquidating any more real-estate, and capex remained relatively the same  

   * Again,  its understandable given the transformation that Capex is where it is  but they should work this down as the transformation to a ‚Äútechnology‚Äù  based company comes to fruition
* The  Net gain from financing is the only real positive, but nothing new.  They knocked out debt and raised capital during the offering last year.  Bottom line, the company risks doing this again (which ""could"" mean  dilution of shares if not improving their other cash flows).

Now  I am here for the long-term, DRSing like everyone else, believe in RC  and the strategy so this is not FUD (fact check my other posts). This is  simply some helpful things to look at when investing in companies.

Finally,  another interesting metric to look at is P/B. This is one that value  investors traditionally looked at, and it‚Äôs a ratio because no company,  at least in the tech industry, trades at book value. Instead, if you  look at tech companies you‚Äôll find that their around a 6x or 10x  multiple‚Ä¶ if you take GME at it‚Äôs current market cap and price you‚Äôll  easily see it‚Äôs undervalued by a few multiples and the GMEDD valuation  of $160 wasn‚Äôt that far off, and perhaps why it was pegged around there  last year.

For you fundamentalists I would love to hear your thoughts, and some of the key metrics you look at?

TL;DR

GME  2021 cash flow wasn‚Äôt the best, ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù they are in the midst of  transforming into a technology company and so it‚Äôs understandable  (you  can contrast other tech startups).

However,  The company does need to improve its cash flow and over the next year  and long-term fundamental investors should keep watch.

This post is simply an EDU on what fundamentals investors look at, and perhaps some of the reason for the negative price action.

This post is outside of any of the other ‚Äúthings‚Äù that could happen to GME. It‚Äôs simply based on the numbers.

CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) is a master limited partnership that produces the nitrogen fertilizers ammonia (NH3) and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN). Because the ticker symbol for CVR Partners is also UAN, I will use CVR to describe the partnership and UAN to describe the fertilizer. Also, because it is a partnership, the payouts to equity holders are distributions rather than dividends.

**Summary**

* Supply shortages are not temporary.
* Demand will only get stronger.
* Record prices for natural gas and coal in Europe and Asia will continue to support higher prices for nitrogen fertilizer.
* Impending tariffs on UAN will keep most imports out of US for over 5 years.
* Distributions of over $40 are expected over the next 7 months.

wallstreetbet,"SPY may reach $500 by end of this yearEven if this week was a bull trap and SPY goes back to $420 next week, as long as the war ends soon, it is possible for SPY to surge to $500 later this year. Ukraine war will be much more transitory compared to inflation. As long as there is no WW3, we can safely assume that the economic damage to US via sanctions will be small, and most of the negative effect is towards higher inflation due to higher oil price.

Hence, I think that the long-term main factor that decides whether the stock market will surge, flat, or fall is inflation and how the Fed's policy pans out to bring the inflation back to 2%. 

On Wednesday, the Fed made it clear that there would be 7 rate hikes this year. This was different from their previous attitude where they chose not to tell how many rate hikes planned for next 2 to 3 years. This previous ""indifferent"" attitude resulted in uncertainties perceived by the market. Will the Fed increase the rate hike by 2% overnight? Will the Fed have 10+ rate hikes this year? Market hates uncertainties, and thus the initial crash before the war crash a month ago.

As the Fed now makes it clear how many rate hikes will be introduced in next 2 to 3 years, this sent the signal to the market that the Fed knows how to combat inflation (at least the market is more confident with the Fed now). Otherwise, the Fed will not tell us how many rate hikes to introduce. This also implies that recession is less likely to happen as the Fed now appears to know what they are doing compared to 2 months ago.

Inflation is not necessarily bad for stock market. Inflation means higher rates, which means higher profits for value stocks. Think companies like Walmart who can charge higher price for their goods. For most of growth stocks, it is not good due to reduced cash flow. However, for big tech companies like Apple and Amazon, they can also charge higher price for their products (iPhone, Prime membership fee), which neutralizes the effect. With the big tech companies constitute higher precentage of the stock market, this means that higher rates do not necessarily mean bad things to the stock market. Furthermore, many big tech companies have their own program of buying shares back, which serves as a catalyst of higher stock price in future. This is in addition to the fact that, in long-term, stock price will increase with inflation (if goods price increases, so should the stock price as long as the number of shares are around the same).

To sum up, it is likely that SPY will surge during later part of the year, and may even surpass $500 and reach $500. April can still be a bear month, but September, October, November and December are much more likely bull months."

I think it‚Äôs an interesting play, if one were to look at the stock‚Äôs chart, we can see that when they previously released a high dividend the share price recovered quite quickly.

Why? Let me explain.

The SHFs shorting GameStop have done so using ETFs, they had originally shorted it by borrowing shares directly.

This is pertinent because those same ETFs are not only being rebalanced next week, but their ex-dividend dates are next week as well. These shares have to be returned to the ETFs for the rebalancing to take place; no extensions.

The cherry on top is that Futures expiry was today, which the Shorts have to cover as well since they failed to roll those contracts.

To sum it up, SHFs have a wall of obligations due next week comprising of Future contracts, ETFs and their dividends.

wallstreetbet,"When you try to be a Contrarian Investor and Fail at Life...Good evening, fellow apes. This is my first real post/discussion and most likely my last. As you can see in the two images, I am a shit investor. The trades that brought me low date back almost 7 years and I have never been green except for maybe my first trade ever for a split second. Today was supposed to be the day I was to get back on track towards turning my account green, but I failed at that as well.

As you can see, my losses have really accelerated in the past few months but they really began in earnest with TSLA back in 2017. I bought TSLA at $320 (pre-split) right before ER and rode it down for the next 3 months until it hit $180. After suffering through that, the first green day after that I sold all 500 shares for $194 or so. Cue Clown music as TSLA soared past my buy in and beyond within a few months. Then the next significant loos was on NCLH, which I bought in Feb2020 for $50 a share right before Covid. I suffered through that trade though the Covid Crash and diamond handed it all the way down to $7 a share and sold it at $12 and didn't look back. So at this point, I started trading volatility AND options like an idiot after seeing TVIX go from $20 to $1000 in a few weeks. Which did not work out either. Then I read about UVXY and began buying puts on it when it spikes, which actually worked for a while, but I got greedy and wanted more gains, so instead of buying longer dated puts for more time, I began playing short dated puts, which was a complete mistake.

After blowing up most of my account trying to be a permabull last SeptemBear, I noticed a funny quirk of UVXY on Quad Witching and the Monday afterwards. If you purchase short dated UVXY calls at the bottom on the Thursday before Quad Witching, which was usually occurred around 1430. There was consistently a pop in UVXYY (due to Vix Futures) the morning of Quad Witching, and an even bigger spike the Monday following. Now I did my ""research"", which consisted of examining the price action for every Quad Witching (SPY, UVXY, and VIX Futures) from 2006-2021 and I discovered that there was consistently a pop in UVXY on both days. Although there was a couple of outliers, which I will discuss below.

So when Dec2021 Quad Witching rolled around, I was prepared to take advantage of this price action. Unfortunately, the Dec2021 Quad witching did not behave exactly like the Sep2021 Quad Witching, so I was caught off guard when UVXY dipped to $14.08 at the open for like 5 minutes, and then mooned on me for the rest of the day. That was not the price action that I was expecting, so I wasn't able to grab the 1k $14 call contracts that I was aiming for. So I watched all this happen and it shot up to $16.82 that day and then mooned to $19 the following Monday right on schedule. I didn't buy in a watched all of this in disgust. So fast forward to yesterday, although the setup was different, UVXY behaved exactly like it did in September, so I went all in on $16.50 UVXY Calls expiring today, which I actually sold at the open today for break even. The problem is that I then FOMO'ed into $17 and $18 UVXY calls expiring next Friday, for Monday.

So as we all know, SPY did not drill today as it has for the past 3 Quad Witchings and mooned like no tomorrow. So my UVXY calls bled out to practically nothing today and brough my account to the shambles that you see above. I don't actually know what I am going to do. I have now lost half a million dollars of my retirement and life savings. I have a pension, so I am fine for money, but I would like to get back even some day, but I don't even know if that is possible at this point. When I see posts like the ape that went from 17K to 75K to 600K on Amazon calls , I get hope, but I have never made a trade that successful before, so I don't even know how to go about it. When I try Amazon or TSLA calls, I just get fucked.

Well, thanks for reading my shitty trader;s story. Hopefully this can be a lesson to someone to not day trade and don't ever try options. Although, to be frank, I was doing terrible even before I discovered options but they just made it just infinitely worse. This has been really cathartic. Have a good day.

wallstreetbet,"Bloomberg: Truce Bets Have Traders Pouncing on Some Ukrainian Debt*  Trium Capital, Legal &amp; General have bought Ukrainian bonds
* GAM Holdings avoiding Ukraine; bought Kazakh, Azeri bonds

&gt;Investors bold enough to bet on a peace deal in Ukraine are already venturing selectively into one of the worst-performing corners of developing markets.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Bargains have opened up as the bonds of Ukraine and other former Soviet states felt the brunt of the selloff in emerging markets after Russia‚Äôs invasion last month. Legal &amp; General Group Plc and Trium Capital are among those to have purchased Ukrainian sovereign debt.  
&gt;  
&gt;The wagers are paying off. Despite conflicting news about progress in peace negotiations, the bonds are among the biggest gainers this week as emerging-market debt heads for its first weekly advance since January.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still optimistic, as a ceasefire would benefit everyone involved, but it will not be easy,‚Äù said Peter Kisler, a London-based hedge fund manager at Trium Capital. ‚ÄúI would add on any meaningful correction, assuming talks continue.‚Äù¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;While a rally in Ukraine‚Äôs bonds prompted Trium Capital to take some profits on Wednesday, the manager is maintaining a bullish position on the debt, Kisler said. He was able to exit his short bets on the ruble and Russian Eurobonds and didn‚Äôt get caught up in the market freeze following the invasion, decisions that contributed to a 15% gain in his fund in February, the manager said.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Uday Patnaik, a London-based money manager at Legal &amp; General, added to his Ukraine position over the past two weeks, selling the debt of the nation‚Äôs companies and putting the money instead into the more liquid sovereign bonds. The manager also bought the sovereign debt of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;This is ‚Äúone of the most interesting buying opportunities since the global financial crisis‚Äù in 2008, Patnaik said. ‚ÄúOn the ceasefire, I should say that things appear to be moving in the right direction, albeit slowly.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Ukraine‚Äôs bond due 2033 was trading around 36 cents on the dollar Friday, after plunging below 20 cents in early March. It was at 88 cents at the beginning of the year.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Avoiding Ukraine  
&gt;  
&gt;GAM Holdings bought the bonds of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan as it expects them to gain on higher oil prices. The Biden administration‚Äôs prohibition on U.S. imports of Russia‚Äôs petroleum won‚Äôt bar American buyers from purchasing oil that travels through the country‚Äôs pipelines or ports but was produced elsewhere -- allowing crude from Kazakhstan to flow.  
&gt;  
&gt;GAM is avoiding Ukraine, which will likely choose to restructure its Eurobonds, said Richard Briggs, a London-based money manager at the firm.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe biggest gainer would probably be Ukraine, but there‚Äôs no certainty of a peace deal anytime soon,‚Äù Briggs said. ‚ÄúBut both Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have very strong fundamentals, which should allow both to be able to cope. Azerbaijan, particularly, will be important for the EU -- for its future gas supplies.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;While Ukraine made an [interest payment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R5AAHLDWRGG0) and sold [‚Äúwar bonds‚Äù](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/ukraine-raises-185-million-in-dollar-hryvnia-war-bond-sale-l0s7jql0) to finance its budget and military expenditure, the risk that it might default on its debt is deterring some investors, including Capitulum Asset Management GmbH.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, Lutz Roehmeyer, the chief investment officer at the Berlin-based firm, is betting on battered assets that will benefit from a surge in commodity prices. His fund bought the Swiss franc-denominated debt of national railways Kazakhstan Temir Zholy during the recent rout. The sovereign bonds of Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan are on his ‚Äúwatchlist,‚Äù he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThey are cheap, have good carry and profit from high commodity prices,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNobody should expect a quick solution in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, so when I buy something it should perform in any case.‚Äù"

wallstreetbet,"A plea for reason: If you have most of your savings in stocks and a recession happens, would you still choose diamond hands over putting food on the table?First, to be clear, I'm not saying a recession will hit anytime soon or that I know when it will hit. And I'm not saying stocks are a bad place to be, as I am invested heavily in stocks. This warning only applies to folks who have spent the majority of their money buying the dip instead of saving some cash for a rainy day. For those people, if you were to lose your job and you had most of your savings in stocks, would you still HODL until you somehow broke even? 

Diamond hands only work under these conditions:  
1) You're not trading with margin (the bank will sell for you)

2) The company doesn't go bankrupt

3) You can meet your living expenses with your cash on hand

If you're degenerate enough to trade on margin, then I don't think there's much I can say to change your mind. And if you'd rather stick with an unprofitable company to its demise rather than keep your money, be my guest. 

But I'm fucking sick of whenever #3 happens. It can happen to anyone. It's easy to say you'll stick with your holdings through thick and thin, but when you lose your job or you have crazy medical expenses (good ol' America), then you **have to sell.** Sure, there were panic sellers in 2008, but you know what? Plenty of people had to sell just to keep paying their mortgage or feed their families, and they completely missed out on the recovery. It breaks my heart since it can be avoided with some discipline, so don't go putting all your money in stocks, and my god, unprofitable companies at that. At least if they pay a **safe** dividend, you get **something** when shit hits the fan. But nonetheless, you still need some cash for a rainy day.

So if you'd rather not starve or would enjoy continuing to have a roof over your head, **you NEED an emergency fund**. If you don't have one, sell enough of your stocks so that you have at least 3 months of living expense covered (rent, food, healthcare, utilities, debt), but ideally 6 months worth. Once you have that, then sure, have your fun and keep buying the dip. Hope y'all stay solvent when shit happens, and no doubt you'll make loads of tendies when the markets turn around!

wallstreetbet,"Shoving your portfolio into TWNK is a great way to ride out this üåàüêª marketIt's official, SPY and QQQ are in a downtrend now that JPow has turned off the money printer. We are in the midst of an inflationary macroenvironment where equities and especially growth stocks in general are suffering, but consumer goods stocks continue to remain a good safe haven for your money. They're probably the best place to park cash in the current inflationary environment which has showed no signs of abating thus far.

So if you're worried about a recession, the Consumer Foods sector will never fail. People always need to eat, irrespective of market conditions, so these stocks will always be in demand. On the other hand, non-essentials and industries like tech and entertainment are more speculative and much more vulnerable to crashing during downturns.

In 2022, you get can safe, consistent gains and protection against inflation with CF stocks, even as the value of cash dwindles over time.

Here's why in particular, I like TWNK

### 1. The obvious reason.

you know

### 2. Very strong financials

Hostess is a strongly profitable company. TWNK has been smashing revenue and earnings targets quarter after quarter with no signs of slowing down. From the latest investor presentation, they've had 9 Consecutive Quarters of 9%+ Net Revenue Growth.

Take a look at growth in the revenue chart. At the very least I would say it is a hold for the next year or so, or until earnings/revenue growth begins to slow.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/stocks\/charts\/TWNK\/hostess-brands\/revenue](https://preview.redd.it/hobsi6m9nky81.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8243fa69637247431701b3652c4311c88afd5fb6)

Right now the market cap is only 3 Billion, but I believe that will grow substantially once the market fully catches up to TWNK's true value based on its future growth plans. Which brings me to:

### 3. Innovation and Expansion Plans

Believe it or not, Hostess out of all companies is legitimately an innovative and growing company. They're using all sorts of data science, AI, and advanced marketing techniques to figure out which channels are the best to target customers. In the past two quarters alone, these efforts have had over a 150% increase in ROI. I'll omit most of the details because if you've made it this far, I can trust you to also read the [2022 Hostess Brands Investor Day Presentation](https://www.hostessbrands.com/events-and-presentations/presentations) and learn more.

Additionally, Hostess is in acquisition mode, have purchased Cloverhill, Voortman, and multiple new bakeries in recent years (2018, 2019, 2020). Basically, they're breaking out of the Sweet Baked goods market ($7 Billion) that contains Twinkies/Ho Hos/Donettes etc and are targeting the cookie market ($8 Billion) as well as the Focused Snacking market ($50+ Billion). Kelloggs and Nabisco better watch out from behind because TWNK is going after Poptarts, Oreos, and Snickers too

### 4. Technical analysis

I'm not a believer in technical analysis voodoo, but what I will do is drop on your lap a chart of TWNK's gains compared to over investments you probably made (a meme stock, SPY, QQQ, and fake internet money)

[TWNK is a gayner](https://preview.redd.it/8flnwv0enky81.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba9db9be1c5d1f980a8d0f8d19e6f85f1fa0065)

I think the charts speak for themselves here- in a üåàüêª market the TWNK always wins.

So if you're looking for a place to park some cash during a bear market, my recommendation is to put it deep inside TWNK.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr** Lots of retards here are getting fucked hard in the ass by their trash stocks, and meanwhile I'm balls deep in TWNK and it's carrying my portfolio. A twinkie a day keeps the margin call away ;)

Positions: reverse cowboy + 500 shares of TWNK"

wallstreetbet,"You deserve to lose money, and I'm happy its happenedI've lurked this subreddit for about 4 years now. I started actively investing in January 2020 right before the pandemic started. I was here when Microsoft 200 FDs and Ally 140 FDs were a fad, and I actually blew up my portfolio being retarded. 

Since then I've seen a lot of great DD here, dude who shilled orange juice futures because of the pandemic was a genius, GME God was obviously ahead o his time with his analysis, the Lumber Liquidator poster was should be prison for manipulation, and by far I have to say the one guy who bet $40,000 on WORK rebounding Q3 2020 will always have a special place in my heart. 

By far the best piece of advice I've seen is to ""Not fight the FED"" policy is more important than I ever realized. Even in 2020 with the pandemic in full force just started, the Federal Reserves QE + Near 0 interest rates were enough to help stimulate the economy and lead to a ""Super V"" stock market recovery. 

A few months ago the Federal Reserve made announcements for interest rate hikes as well as reducing their balance sheet. I sold my positions in technology companies as they were expected to go down first and braced for impact. 

Since then I've seen people on this sub continue to shill AMC, GME, and other memes and turned away from DD. Why I do not know. 

But I see now a lot of portfolios in the red, as expected, but a lot of ignorance as well. People surprised the market has gone bear, saying this market can go ""in either direction"", buying retard FD calls and hoping for the best. A lot of misinformed bs.

This board used to be useful, I used to learn from the posts on here. Now every topic revolves around GME, AMC, or some other investment involving screwing over some short position. Same shit, day in day out. 

You're losing money because youre ignorant, refusing to pay attention to the market and economy, as well as avoiding contributing anything meaningful to this space.

While everyone was shitting their pants losing their weekly allowances from mom on SPY 0DTEs hoping JPOW would save the day, the entire community overlooked the beginning of one of the biggest potential comebacks of all time. M'ladies and retards, I am talking about CLOV. Of couse I didn't put it in the title, because if I did I'd be downvoted into oblivion because hating turds that crashed 90% is easy. If you're just gonna autistically screech on your keyboard because I mentioned an unmentionable, do yourself a favor and really flesh it out so you can at least harvest some internet points to make up for all the money you lost this past week.

I don't have the patience nor intellectual capacity to link a bunch of fancy charts and TA so maybe you'll actually read through this entire post instead of falling for another bot pump and dump thinking to yourself ""wow this guy seems professional, fuck it I'll YOLO.""

Here are the key highlights for their Q1 2022 earnings today:

After a huge fall from grace CLOV is currently sitting on a $1.27 billion market cap. At just $2.79 right now, you couldn't even exchange a share for a 10 piece at Wendy's but don't worry, Burger King offers 8 shitty nuggets for just $1 so all the bagholders won't go hungry - for now.

Q1 EPS: (0.16) vs (0.25 expected) (parentheses means negative because throwing a minus sign in front of a figure looks bad)

Q1 Revenue: $874M. That is not a typo. $874 MILLION dollars in ONE quarter for a company with a $1.27B market cap. That is a 437% increase from Q1 2021 revenue of $200M. Not to mention Clover Assistant SaaS as another potential revenue stream. I can already hear the doubters: ""But OG\_ClapCheekz69, revenue doesn't mean shit in this market if it's hemorrhaging cash."" And that is a fair point, which brings me to my next.

Q1 Net Loss: $75 Million. At this rate, CLOV is burning $300M a year. Terrifying right? Well, in a stroke of sheer genius/autism CLOV management paid a local fortune teller $5 and she told the interim CFO (who needs a real CFO anyways) to really fuck the shareholders and do an offering back in November, before the market went to complete shit. Thanks to gypsy magic, CLOV is now sitting on around $700M cash/assets and with no adjustments, they'll be able to keep the lights on for at least 2.5 more years. Not to mention, the health care sector is recession and inflation proof - people will need medicare and their doctors no matter how the economy and markets are doing.

Here's the real meat and potatoes:

Medicare Advantage Medical Care Ratio: 96.4%

Direct Contracting Medical Care Ratio: 99.8%

What is Medical Care Ratio? Hopefully someone in the comments will explain it better than I can, but basically if it weren't for minor details /s like salaries, operating costs, etc. CLOV would be netting positive right now. Why is this a highlight? This is the first quarter that CLOV had a sub 100% Medical Care Ratio which is a HUGE indicator that they are progressing smoothly down the path to profitability. Not to mention, it gives them street cred and helps bump up their CMS rating (which I guess is like Yelp for insurance). They currently have a CMS rating of 3.5 stars, but I've been told that 4 is where the magic happens, and with everything going on that can be expected in 2023-2024.

To wrap things up, CLOV management has all but promised profitability by 2023. Industry average for profitable companies is 3x annual revenue, which would put CLOV at a $12B market cap or share price of around $25 for a 10 bagger. Lives under management grew from 66,000 to 257,000 year over year. the Medicare market is projected to be worth $1.25 TRILLION in 2025. That's a bigass TAM.

People always say ""damn, I wish I could find an undervalued company"" but when they're presented with one, they just laugh and call you retarded for suggesting it. See you all in a few years when I'm either sitting on 8 figures or scrounging for a fresh cardboard box to call home.

Godspeed retards.

wallstreetbet,"Inflation and recession proof DD backed by $1.48MBottom line up front: Position: 537,000 shares at $2.65 [PoSition - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/NXmrD33)

While everyone was shitting their pants losing their weekly allowances from mom on SPY 0DTEs hoping JPOW would save the day, the entire community overlooked the beginning of one of the biggest potential comebacks of all time. M'ladies and retards, I am talking about CLOV. Of couse I didn't put it in the title, because if I did I'd be downvoted into oblivion because hating turds that crashed 90% is easy. If you're just gonna autistically screech on your keyboard because I mentioned an unmentionable, do yourself a favor and really flesh it out so you can at least harvest some internet points to make up for all the money you lost this past week.

I don't have the patience nor intellectual capacity to link a bunch of fancy charts and TA so maybe you'll actually read through this entire post instead of falling for another bot pump and dump thinking to yourself ""wow this guy seems professional, fuck it I'll YOLO.""

Here are the key highlights for their Q1 2022 earnings today:

After a huge fall from grace CLOV is currently sitting on a $1.27 billion market cap. At just $2.79 right now, you couldn't even exchange a share for a 10 piece at Wendy's but don't worry, Burger King offers 8 shitty nuggets for just $1 so all the bagholders won't go hungry - for now.

Q1 EPS: (0.16) vs (0.25 expected) (parentheses means negative because throwing a minus sign in front of a figure looks bad)

Q1 Revenue: $874M. That is not a typo. $874 MILLION dollars in ONE quarter for a company with a $1.27B market cap. That is a 437% increase from Q1 2021 revenue of $200M. Not to mention Clover Assistant SaaS as another potential revenue stream. I can already hear the doubters: ""But OG\_ClapCheekz69, revenue doesn't mean shit in this market if it's hemorrhaging cash."" And that is a fair point, which brings me to my next.

Q1 Net Loss: $75 Million. At this rate, CLOV is burning $300M a year. Terrifying right? Well, in a stroke of sheer genius/autism CLOV management paid a local fortune teller $5 and she told the interim CFO (who needs a real CFO anyways) to really fuck the shareholders and do an offering back in November, before the market went to complete shit. Thanks to gypsy magic, CLOV is now sitting on around $700M cash/assets and with no adjustments, they'll be able to keep the lights on for at least 2.5 more years. Not to mention, the health care sector is recession and inflation proof - people will need medicare and their doctors no matter how the economy and markets are doing.

Here's the real meat and potatoes:

Medicare Advantage Medical Care Ratio: 96.4%

Direct Contracting: 99.8%

What is MCR?

Most of the tech/growth stocks visited the 3/5/2021 price around 2 months later (NIO/TSLA). On 3/5/2021, UPST hit a low of $42.51 and never visited that price for over a year, and it first went to $400.

wallstreetbet,Am I doing this right?
wallstreetbet,"I don't necessarily agree with the narrativeThere is a lot of good and high hope individuals on here, saying things like do not sell, hold and it will recover, if you sell you will lose.

Now these people are trying to bump up moral and in a good way.

While it is true that typically and historically stocks will go back up, to say not to sell and to hold is not necessarily the right thing either.

Let's say your down ~~-%20~~ \-%55 and you anticipate that due to the markets, state of the economy among various other factors that at least the short to medium term is not looking all that ripe and that the market will go drill team six further then it has, well, if there was a rally for that position and your now only down ~~-%10~~ \-%20, if you decided to sell with the anticipation that both the stock and market would go further down then ~~-%20~~ \-%55, this move here could be very smart.

Unlike the dot.com and '08 era, we have a lot, I mean way more negative factors in our economy today then during those events.

Going cash and playing options its not so bad either. Same goes for entering into new positions or DCA when the stock becomes a value stock in comparison to its trading price using real fundamentals.

There is a negative effect to holding with this mindset in place. For example, there are many many people still ""holding"" there positions from the dot.com era that are still holding just to break even.

There's a guy I believe who wrote in a comment a while ago about how he bought Nokia at $180.00 during the dot.com era and is still holding, to give more of a perspective.

I personally, am under the belief that we have more to go before the storm clears. 

I'll be looking at value plays over the next while as well as SPY puts every time it rallies.

If you have the opportunity to make adjustments to your portfolio and bets in order to limit losses and to try and maximize gains, why wouldn't you if the opportunity presents itself."

wallstreetbet,"Silverback StrongI come to you in a time of pain and fear with a message: it will get better, and you will be rewarded. But only if you don‚Äôt sell. 

I am over 40, which translates to 99 with you youngsters. I have lost $430,000 from my portfolio since Nov 15th, and have the screenshots to prove it.

I was in my early thirties in 2008 when the housing market halved my measly 401k and tanked my $2k worth of Starbucks stock, the only stock I owned. I remember one day telling my wife I was selling the stock, and asking if we should empty out our 401ks, taking the tax hit, in an effort to salvage what we could. We had $35k in the bank and rented in a major city.

‚ÄúPut $20k into the market,‚Äù is what she, a Harvard economist, told me. ‚ÄúBuy when there‚Äôs blood in the streets. Don‚Äôt try to time the market. Buy what you use and some blue chips. Everything‚Äôs on sale.‚Äù

I balked. I was born very poor, and still thought like a poor person.

But I used that $20k to buy stock. Ford. GM. Blockbuster. They fucked me. But I also bought Amazon. Netflix. Google. Facebook. And later Tesla. I bought what I enjoyed using.

And because of this, $425k hurts, but it won‚Äôt kill me. I‚Äôve made a shit ton of money over the last 14 yrs off stocks, because I bought and held. I didn‚Äôt even buy at the bottom, but I bought when others were selling.

Buy now. And if you can‚Äôt buy: hold.

If you panic sell, you WILL lose money. If you hold, you WILL eventually make money. I promise you. YOU WILL MAKE MONEY.

Here is my promise to all you sad poor young motherfuckers getting reamed right now:

As your fucking elder, as a SILVERBACK, I WILL NOT SELL A SINGLE FUCKING STOCK UNTIL THIS MARKET RETURNS TO THE HIGHS OF JANUARY 1, 2022.

If we unite, and we hold, we all make money.

I call upon the other SILVERBACKS not about to retire to make this pledge with me: No more selling.

https://preview.redd.it/3smjon0bgjy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89bab1ec3b88b20f2210b8953f7233d94ad2793a

This is a breadth indicator it essentially indicates the sell/ buy pressure of SPY, NASDAQ, NYSE. The A/d is advancing/ declining stocks, TRIN is TRIN, TICK is the spy tick and then IV rank. 

At open today SPY was sitting at -98.52. I have NEVER in my life seen it that high for instance last weeks big bearish day never saw over -38 breadth‚Ä¶ and most red days a big sell pressure is -10. So that was interesting to say the least. But the weird thing is that with that sort of sell pressure we did not see the massive sell off one would expect. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dht4axjbgjy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=950320cd4e76c8e117c6d332e27b919e71f5729d

As you can see we maintained a nice bear channel today all day. The most impressive thing was that 400 held as support from 11am until 315pm when it finally saw a candle body close below it and inevitably closed lower EOD. There was 11 candles that failed to close a body below 400 today. That is the most I have ever seen one support or resistance line reject price action. The oddity about EOD today was that we saw a nice rally that was even supported by volume start at 245pm and continue in power hour that was rejected at 402.6 and led to a 0.8% sell off on one candle. Watching the price action leading up to that candle the rejection was not warranted and it very much so looked ready to retest 404 and 405. I am even more impressed that bears were able to close this below 400 and even saw the lowest price action since March 31st 2021. 

Tomorrow we will have to see how 400 interacts with SPY in the morning and over night. I think if SPY can open above 400 we can see a green day tomorrow. If we continue to trade under 400 and specifically if we open red we might see our next leg down. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ma79di9cgjy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=889349041dd21ce31bc511c68c47236f258a54db

SPY came within $1.50 of touching support of the red (now 7 week long) and orange (5 month long) bear channels. I have had this orange bear channel drawn since march. I am a little surprised we didn‚Äôt see 395 hit EOD as that was support of both the red and orange bear channel. So now we are in an interesting spot. Very rarely do we see candles ‚Äústack‚Äù on top of eachother like we have today. By stack I mean the bottom of the previous candle and top of this candle are nearly parrallel. This year there has only been 3 times this has happened. 

Now we are at an interesting crossroads on the daily. On one hand we have the red channel which has been going strong since March 29th that has a support tomorrow of 392. However, the orange channel which is the general downward bear market trend we have been in since january is support of 395. Now we do not need to see support exactly hit and realistically $1.5 is pretty close for the daily to call it a support bounce. 

Realistically tomorrow we should expect a green day based off the daily trend. While we could possibly just ride this support line all the way down further it seems very unlikely at this point as spy generally hard bounces off supports and resistances. Upper channel resistance tomorrow will be 421. Now of course im not suggesting that we see 421 im just suggesting that‚Äôs the upper limit as in no limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/33cbnlfdgjy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95301f5b89f9aabc6a4be19b54d08783ca164283

I generally don‚Äôt include the weekly chart on the intraweek TA but you can see we broke this grey channel and we also failed to make it to the bottom of the orange channel which is too at 395. The onne thing to note is that we are looking at our 6th red candle in a row now. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ifymobxdgjy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a15ac7078c80ccfd0dfaeb429b26adc50589513

This is the 2008 crash and I want to draw your attention to the arrow. That right there is where I believe we are with SPY present day. I think if we get an awful CPI Wednesday we are going to see a massively red week. Like we will see 360 if not lower this week. However, if we get a good CPI I think we are going to bounce this week seeing some green and late this month or next continue the down cycle. I still believe we see 360. 

Major support is 395 √† 392 √† 360? 

Major resistance- 405 (daily and weekly major major resistance point) √† 412 √† 417 √† 420

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing that im watching going into tomorrow is this VIX level. We are trading at the extreme upper limit of the VIXs range for the last 5 months. Realistically we should see the vix unravel and come down closer to 30 tomorrow leading into CPI. There is a slight case to be made that we see a morning spike to 40 on the VIX and that starts the unravel of the VIX but there really isn‚Äôt a sustainable case to warrant the VIX hanging on to these levels for much longer. 

I posted an article I wrote this weekend about the last 4 months of CPI data. It actually gives a 75% odds of a bull run tomorrow and a 50% odds we see &gt;1.5% green day tomorrow. There is a 25% chance we see greater then -1.7% red day though. 

Today had a 75% chance of being red and it did finish red. The day of CPI has a 75% chance of finishing red and the day after CPI has a 75% chance of finishing red and a 100% chance of finishing redder than -1.3% (if it‚Äôs a red day). 25% chance we finish &gt;1.15%. there is a 50% chance we go on a bull run vs a bear run for the two weeks after CPI is released. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cgz6wmdhgjy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4168f5d53253d4d752defc4a4ed0b9e4d773d3df

The thing about QQQ is that it actually broke its downward red channel (case could be made SPY will do the same now). I did adjust the current support line of the channel as the upper resistance line seems very stout. I am looking to see where QQQ goes tomorrow and over night to see if we are going to bounce or not. This COULD be the support line bounce and we could see a move upwards now. If we do resistance will be 310. Current support tomorrow is 295 followed by the bottom of the grey channel at 282. 

Overall tomorrow I am actually pretty bullish. While I 1000% believe we are in a major downward channel I think we are due for a bear market rally and I think whether it starts tomorrow or Wednesday its going to come. My target would be 420-430 conservatively. Now my one caveat to that is if CPI Wednesday comes in hot and heavier then expected (remember this is the first time they have predicted it goes down) we are going to end up with a major downward dump. I think if that CPI is terrible we could see the -20% week and easily see 360 SPY. 

10% challenge- 

Today wasn‚Äôt too bad of a day I had made some morning gains took a very small loss during the day and then ended up getting caught on a fake bounce from 400 support. I carried the calls till about 414 and ended up closing then for a -27% loss. Theta ate them pretty heavily being 2dte. Unfortunately I had an opportunity during power hour to close green and I failed to do so. Definitely regrets. As I mentioned I am bullish for tomorrow and even Wednesday I opened some 4dte 400C calls. Today I also averaged down my 25dte 446C. I am now at a breakeven of 414. I was at a solid break even of 410 before the EOD dump. I am pretty much maxed out on that play right now but if we see 390 I will look to average down one time and roll them to 60dte. But if we get the bull run I suspect us to get this week and next those calls will pay off nicely.

Here is a projection I'm making that is very unsettling for my American cohort that doesn't own a home already.

As interest rates in the US rise, the ability of an American consumer to buy a house with a higher mortgage payment goes down.

However, if the dollar doesn't appreciate commensurately against other currencies, then I worry that foreign buyers could take out loans in their home country with lower interest rates, offsetting any weakness in their home currency.

After I just typed this in the post, I realized isn't this an arbitrage opportunity  in a more general way?

The strategy is take a loan out in your home country, buy US dollars, then buy US 2Y treasuries or buy someone's mortgage?

TL;DR How are we protecting American home buyers from foreign low rates, other than dollar strength? Is there any other way?"

-  Elon was accumulating shares until he was forced to report by the SEC, this is the only reason for 9.2% news and he continued buying more. 
-  The news of him buying 9.2% served him well because share holders was selling because they were intoxicated by the initial spike the news caused

wallstreetbet,"$TRVI Potential Huge Gainer (?)$TRVI, Trevi Therapeutics, is a company which was delisted by NASDAQ previously, and has recently become relisted, after two years. They're currently in testing with a new drug, **Haduvio**.   
On 4-11, there were **nine** individuals with 10%+ stakes in the company which bought into it, along with one institution for whom they all work: New Enterprise Associates 16, LP.   
Honestly, I think NEA just straight took over TRVI, since they owned a large portion of them prior to this latest buy already.   
This most recent buying took place as a $55 million private placement sale, and is what caused the stock price jump around April 7th  
Institutional Ownership (yet to reflect most recent purchase by NEA): [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/ownership/nas-trvi/fi-bpr6u2?ownershipType=institutional](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/ownership/nas-trvi/fi-bpr6u2?ownershipType=institutional)  


The stock is currently up 45% in the past week, with 7% of that today, and is currently looking like it's actually trying to go to the moon. Its recent volume is pretty low, half of its listed average. There were significant buy trends over the past week, leading the stock to currently be at nearly a 75 on the RSI scale, meaning it may be leaning towards overbought (and therefore potentially overvalued). They've got a debt-to-equity ratio of .51, and a current / quick ratio of 2.98. In tandem with those ratios is a **""D"" Credit Rating** by Equifax.   
I don't personally see them going bankrupt, especially with this most recent, *huge* investment from NEA. I think this has a lot of potential for long-term growth - a multibagger in my (admittedly retarded) opinion.   


I can't find any negative forecasting for TRVI, and I really can't find any negative analyst ratings at all - only buy ratings. It is admittedly a small-cap stock, and is at a very relatively low price, but possibly has the potential for a large price spike in the coming future.   


What do y'all think? I'm pretty sure I'm going to be buying this tomorrow - I don't have any positions on it currently since I've only really finished researching it now. It's up 288% YTD

I have a lot more tabs open and have a bunch more I could try and fit into this post, but I think this is plenty to open the conversation up to see what people with hopefully a few more IQ points have to say about its likely prospects. I really think that they're going to have their ship ""righted"", and going to surge in price more than they already have - though admittedly I may be a few days too late to the biggest gains, with the most recent price jump.

wallstreetbet,"How to Push Robinhood Closer to Bankruptcy*Disclaimer: I Am Not A Lawyer (IANAL). I am not suggesting you do anything other than consult with an attorney, preferably one that specializes in securities arbitration.*

If you lost money with Robinhood, there is a chance you could get some, or all, of your money back through FINRA arbitration, which can be more expensive for Robinhood than you.

Instead of YOLO'ing your next paycheck on options, think about YOLO'ing it on some lawyers to give RobinHood the hurt.  Thousands of FINRA claims could be crushing.

**Possible Causes for Action**

Remember when Robinhood gave you free stock for opening an account? Did you get free stock for inviting a friend? Did you buy more of that stock because Robinhood gave you some? Did you subsequently lose money on that stock? If so, that might be construed as Robinhood recommending an investment that wasn‚Äôt suitable for you as an investor.

Did you try to buy a stock and had cash to do so (not a margin trade), but Robinhood wouldn‚Äôt let you? Did the stock go up after you would have bought it? Did you own a stock that Robinhood only allowed people to sell but not buy? Did the stock go down after the restriction? Robinhood might have failed to properly accept and execute orders.

Did Robinhood approve you for trading options or margins, only for you to lose money and realize you were over your head? Robinhood might have failed to exercise due diligence before approving your account for options or margins trading.

Was Robinhood clear about potential losses on options, or clear about margin calls? Robinhood might have negligently communicated false or misleading information.

**FINRA Arbitration Ground Rules (AFAIK)**

Robinhood CANNOT consolidate FINRA cases into class action (rule 12204). Each claim must be resolved individually. With millions of customers and potentially hundreds of thousands of claims, that‚Äôs a lot of billable hours.

Generally, arbitration must occur at the location closest to the customer‚Äôs residence (rule 12213). Virtual arbitration can occur only with the consent of all parties. If you don‚Äôt consent, Robinhood will either need to hire a lot of local attorneys (meaning it can‚Äôt internalize the cost to its corporate legal team) or rack up a lot of frequent flyer miles.

The time limit on claims is six years (rule 12206). You can wait until the total amount of claims is worth the fees you would spend.

**TL;DR**

I am not a lawyer, but if you consult one, there‚Äôs a chance you can get some of your money back and hurt Robinhood in the process.

wallstreetbet,"Dension MinesYou won't know me from my previous Uranium DD because gay mods fucked up the DD flair.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u1x2lq/uranium\_neuron\_firing\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u1x2lq/uranium_neuron_firing_edition/)

So I'm back here with DD on Denison Mines and some thoughts on uranium miners in general.

**Lower prices should come**

I'm here to shill my YouTube channel not pump stocks so I'll be honest. We should see lower prices in many of the miners soon.

https://preview.redd.it/16apj57bget81.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c79a60ef2d09df10b51fd685955d3bf533200719

We completed a major wave 1 from 2020 to 2021. Major wave 2 correction for a very nice 0.5 fib from Nov last year to Jan this year. So we are currently in the midst of the first wave of major wave 3.

I believe we are currently in minor wave 5 of wave 1 of major wave 3. Mean we are due for a wave 2 correction soon.

Uranium ETFs are sitting right at 70 RSI, CCJ the sector bellwether is also at RSI, signaling entry into oversold range.

With DNN, I see RSI still has a big of space to run and MACD is just turning green, leading me to believe that we will quickly run up to 2+ once we clear the current resistance.

My trade is to exit at $2 because I don't want to be stuck in the wave 2 that is coming. I'll buy back some time in wave 2, currently target 1.5 before starting to scale in.

Disclaimer, I still have a lot to learn in TA, most of my information I get taking reference from [https://twitter.com/UraniumCharts](https://twitter.com/UraniumCharts), [https://twitter.com/EastWest\_Advice](https://twitter.com/EastWest_Advice) and My TA guy IRL.

**But you said miners were shit!**

And I still stand by my words. Inflation, rising rates, bad debt and rising rates are all very real concerns for many of the miners out there.

BUT

DNN manage to give some insight into how they will face this, which gives me a great deal of confidence knowing that they have a plan.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAhHcjeIIlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=BloorStreetCapital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAhHcjeIIlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=BloorStreetCapital)

This interview dated 31 March gives a lot of insight into their plan going ahead.

The video spends a big amount of time talking about their BIG DICK HIGH FLOW ISR mining method but that's old info if you had read their investor presentations.

It's the discussion on balance sheet, whether they will sell the 2.5m pounds of uranium they are holding as well as whether they have been using their ATM offering that spur me into writing this DD.

A big part of their strategy in dealing with CAPEX for the flagship Phoneix project is their purchase of 2.5m pounds of uranium at $30/pound.

In the video, they mentioned that the 2.5mil pound is worth about 2/3 third of CAPEX needed as of the video. They don't intend to sell it just yet and can use it as a negotiating leverage against utilities for financing.

Instead of asking for financing from the traditional banks, they can now go to desperate utilities and get the financing they need with better conditions while the utilities get to de-risk by having access to some ready to go uranium.

They also mentioned that the ATM offering hasn't been used much and it's completely optional for them to use, which is reassuring.

I'm not going to trust their words 100% but getting an update on their financials straight from the CEO takes away a big part of my worries.

**Why I like Denison Mines**

Information from their March 2022 investors presentation.

https://preview.redd.it/5vuw3457let81.png?width=1477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=877feb3487106b0a55c8afa98fa86338049fa003

Numbers are dated 2018 so do account for inflation but their ""high case"" uranium prices are $65/lb which we already are at LMAO.

https://preview.redd.it/cbvaxqt3met81.png?width=1229&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab9eec8de7bd382cfe2ed4b274cefc3affcd2ba3

One of the lowest all in costs of ALL the projects out there.

**ISR Mining**

Basically, instead of traditional mining they drill holes into the ground, pump some mining solution into it and pump out the mining solution after it dissolves uranium in the mine.

Saves a lot of money but the risk is that it is a new mining method.

Below is what they have done to de-risk the method.

https://preview.redd.it/ieumjq23net81.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92978e8293104c87862695003dc2c11f85eb80e8

In 2021, they managed to reach commercial scale flow-rate and based hit a lot of the targets they were aiming for.

I won't lie, I'm no mining expert so I don't really know what they are doing very well but I'm sold from the investor presentations.

Anyone with a better understanding do let me know in the comments.

**Phoenix project**

They were aiming for 2024 production but Covid hit and caused some delays so they haven't given an updated timeline.

6m pounds of production per year.

Roughly $50/pound profit right now, which comes down to 300m of free cash flow at current prices.

Even with a shitty 10 P/E, you're looking at 3B market cap once they hit production in maybe 2024.

That's an ultra-conservative estimate already.

Target uranium price X 6m X P/E ratio and you can get your valuation for the free cash flow they will generate with those parameters.

Then you give it a discount rate to find out what you are willing to pay for it right now.

Long story short, I think uranium prices will go higher and I'm happy with the current prices.

**Other projects**

They have other projects avaliable, own 22.5% stake in a uranium mill, a lot of exploration land.

But I don't care.

My valuation is simply ""Phoenix Project"" and ""Bonus Stuff"".

Their priority is on getting Phoenix up and running then they have the money to start other mines.

**TLDR**

Solid fundamentals even if valued very conservatively. Short term top is coming, look to buy in again when it dips.

**Positions**

25k shares, selling at $2-$2.1, will scale back in starting $1.5

Honestly, nothing much has changed since November last year. Inflation risk got higher, liquidity crunch risk got higher, so of course valuation are dampened and I'll be putting less money into this.

wallstreetbet,"TSLA Micro DD; The most condensed and valuable TSLA DD you'll ever need($12,000 GAAP earnings per EV sold) \* (20,000,000 EVs sold annually) \* (50 P/E) =

$12T market cap or approximately $12,000/share

Do I expect these numbers to happen? I dunno, doesn't matter what I think.. but you know what's important? The extraordinary potential upside for TSLA. I encourage everyone to use your own numbers. This DD will aim to educate you on identifying what these three numbers could become, and how to keep track of TSLA as an investment

1) GAAP earnings per EV

|Quarter|GAAP EPS|EVs Delivered|GAAP earnings per EV sold|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021 Q1|$0.39|184,800|$2,361|
|2021Q2|$1.02|201,250|$5,671|
|2021 Q3|$1.44|241,300|$6,677|
|2021 Q4|$2.05|308,650|$7,432|

Your homework: How is GAAP earnings per EV going up? and How high will it go? These are not easy questions to answer. You have to dig. Check out ASP, gross margin and operating margin for Tesla, as well as their trends. Understand Economies of Scale and Wright's Law. Look into the innovation that Tesla is attempting in building EVs. Finally, every quarter.. do your math! GAAP earnings per EV = (GAAP EPS \* outstanding shares)/(EVs delivered). Use [ir.tesla.com](https://ir.tesla.com) as your source

2) EVs sold annually

This is the biggest risk to Tesla and most important thing to monitor imo: execution. Their goal is 50% growth in sales YoY. To be bullish, we have to see them hit that goal.

Homework: Do your math to predict sales based on 50% growth YoY, and watch to see if they achieve their goal. They sold 936,000 in 2021, if they grow at 50% YoY, what year will they reach 20M?

3) P/E

Unfortunately, there will always be speculation here. Tesla will likely always try to innovate and find new businesses to grow. They're currently focused on Solar and Energy, FSD and the Tesla Bot in addition to EVs. So long as there's new innovative business opportunities, what P/E value does that justify? Your homework is to make your own speculation here. 25 P/E? 50 P/E? 10 P/E? You decide.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, use your own numbers! Decide if this upside is really there, and if you decide that TSLA could continue to grow, then you're now equipped with some nice metrics to follow and help you maintain conviction in your holding.

wallstreetbet,"On Tuesday, March CPI hit a 40-year high. On Wednesday, the monthly PPI rate hit a 12-year high in March. How do you think this will affect the stock market?Announcement Tuesday: The U.S. March seasonally adjusted annual CPI was 8.5%, a 40-year high (CPI Consumer Price Index).

Announced on Wednesday: the US March PPI month rate was 1.4% (PPI producer price index). Producer prices rose 11.2% year-on-year in March, the largest gain on record.

The impact of rising inflation on the stock market is mainly reflected in investment sentiment on the future market, including the move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Some institutions commented on the US PPI data: The annual rate of PPI in March was 11.2%, the highest since 2010, highlighting the possibility that early inflationary pressures will persist and be transmitted to final consumer goods. They also said: The PPI and CPI reports have increased the pressure on the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. The Fed has left the door open for a 50 basis point rate hike in May. From this point of view, then the Fed's sharp interest rate hike will definitely reduce the liquidity of the market and have a great impact on the stock market. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

I think the sharp rise in PPI is mostly driven by supply chain and energy price hikes, and it will take several months to pass through to consumer goods. This portends higher inflation in the future.

NTSG plunged 32.8% toward a two-year low in morning trading Wednesday, enough to make them the biggest losers trading on major U.S. exchanges, after the provider of life science discovery tools warned about a revenue miss, citing execution missteps. The company said late Tuesday that it now expects first-quarter product and service revenue of $31 million, below the previously provided guidance range of $34 million to $38 million. Chief Executive Brad Gray said the disappointing revenue was a result of uneven sales execution, which resulted in an ""imbalance"" between capturing fourth-quarter revenue and developing first-quarter opportunities, something that was compounded by changes made to re-align the company's commercial team. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Daniel Arias reiterated his buy rating and $70 stock price target, saying he believed the ""unwelcome execution setback"" is more like a speed bump than a structural issue, and the stock's selloff appeared to be ""way overdone.""



I think with the past history $70 is absurd. That said it sits at $22 now and the sell off was way too much of an overreaction. I think this can touch $30 again this week and net 25-30%. Held $22 all day basically so good support and should bounce back tomorrow 10-15%."

wallstreetbet,"I'm Creating An Index Fund - Tracking Nancy Pelosi's Trades ($NANCY)Why do corrupt politicians get to have all the fun, and more importantly **- make all the money**?

Are you fed up with corruption? Do you want to join in on all the fun going on, behind the scenes, but legally?

I'd like to petition r/wallstreetbets to support me in creating an Index Fund, that tracks the intraday holdings of Nancy &amp; Paul Pelosi. If you've created an index fund before, please DM me.

The fund would rebalance daily and would have a near net zero expense ratio. **Any asset allocation whether it be direct equity exposure or options trading by Nancy &amp; Paul would be directly tracked.** Proceeds could even go to some joint fund to assist the Wall Street Bets community, we can entertain different ideas.

* If there's a behind the scenes meeting about electric vehicle regulation, **you're in on it**. 
* If there's a law about to be passed, but is not materially known, **you're making money**.
* If Nancy &amp; Paul are going to pull some snake shit, **you get to profit**.

Can someone put me in touch with a broker that can assist in creating this fund?

Many people have $150k-$200k/annual salary, but how many of these people have $250M like Nancy and Paul? Make a seat for me at the table, Nancy. I want in.

This fund would certainly destroy SPY/QQQ indexes and would annihilate any and all of the ARK funds. 

We don't have much time left. Let's get moving boys.

I thought $NANCY had a nice ring to it (Simple and to the point), as a ticker - but open to suggestions here.

April 13 Recap

Technology companies led stock gains, with bond traders reducing aggressive bets on Fed rate hikes amid speculation that inflation is nearing a peak. Investors also considered the start of the earnings season in light of geopolitical risks.

The S&amp;P 500 ended a three-day decline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed. Another drop in treasury two-year yields, which are more sensitive to upcoming monetary-policy decisions, brought this week's drop to around 15 basis points.

Oil was trading for more than $100 per barrel.

Traders also kept an eye on the latest geopolitical developments, such as Biden's announcement that the United States will expand the size and scope of weapons provided to Ukraine in a new $800 million military aid package. This includes heavy artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers, indicating a more serious commitment than the country has already made, as well as artillery rounds and additional helicopters

I remember people scoffing at TSLA back in 2013, or people scoffing at Apple over the past 15 years. 

I just feel like the cocktail of mass of ignorance, negative sentiment, and a profitable growth company can turn into a massive home run stock.

Daddy BGC is back and I can see some weapons-grade copium in this sub and on Twitter, I tried to warn you anon but you continued to average down as your puts withered away in those disgusting little ape hands of yours.

But worry not I'm back again to spit some fire for the second time, you thought this run was over? Silly little anon it's only just begun the majority of you bears have diamond-handed your puts and that can only mean one thing: there will be a lot of loss porn this weekend and this easter Jesus isnt the only person that will be coming.

Let's talk about the theta decay and why we are going to see higher before we see lower:

[The average gay bear's portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/brk0fe4q3dt81.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecda0de29a00dce89c495d463471c34fa681efc6)

As you can see from the professionally drawn graph, as the time to expiry decreases the rate at which the options value decreases increases exponentially, for the retards among us you lose money faster closer to the end of the day.

Now today there was an uptick in calls which is good to see but the important thing is that the majority of put positions are still open and it looks like the bears have doubled down as there are 20k new put positions opened at the 434 strike as well increases in the 435 strike. Depending on how we open we could see bears instantly crushed or a slow bleed throughout the day with a price target of 445 and moonboi price targets of 450.

&amp;#x200B;

# Look at that fat purple dildo it's a fuckin beauty eh?

I spit in the face of bears while I take their money, today was a great day for both and it will only keep getting better tomorrow. My predictions are either:

1. We gap up in premarket and gay bears get crushed and capitulate as we spike at open and potentially go sideways/ trend up or down a little.
2. We open flat or a little down and we see some selling in the morning until a gradual climb back up especially post 1 PM where the theta decay will start to increase dramatically and start to see charm effects ramping up.

# This section is for the retards on my last post saying that market go down because of fancy lines someone drew:

You have to be autistic to believe lines make a difference, Market makers and institutions push the market where they want it and everyone else has to eat that shit sandwich whether we like it or not, MMs are net short and will rehedge as bears sell their puts for losses pushing us higher.

POSITIONS: Bought and sold spy contracts for a decent gain throughout the day but holding now:

wallstreetbet,"MSTR / RIOT / COIN / MARA - Why Isn't This Garbage At Zero Already?Found some fantastic setups in these extraordinarily shitty companies. Will keep this short and sweet. Please keep in mind **there are specific entries for these short plays**. Most short setups are uptrends until they break down - which means do not enter before said entry triggers - or you are likely to get assfucked by Theta and his frat bro Delta.

\---

Let's start with my favorite one: $MSTR

[$MSTR 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/79z4gxiw0dt81.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af748d2f48b17c16bcc63e28f5eefa1275d6e63)

Red is a bear flag which broke down --&gt; retested. You can see the results - perfect follow through. Nailed this 402 support and decided to form **another** bear flag on top of it. This one is smaller, but better because it has three clear reactions to the lower line. It also has confluence. For you retards, that means things lining up that generate a higher probability of success for the play. In this case, that **402** level lines up right with our entry.

To play this one, you wanna wait for a **weekly** close below 402. From there, I am targeting **273.75 and 160.50.** Seems like a stretch, but if these companies leveraged to the tits in bullshit jpegs really go ass up, it's possible. At least that's what the chart says. For this one I'm looking @ July 250 puts.

Moving on to: $RIOT

[$RIOT 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/kqu9228k1dt81.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cc9ac51a13db40ecd9156390fdef9437da1bcac)

Basically the same fucking thing just wedges instead, I don't need to explain that shit. Reason I don't like it as much is because there is less confluence. There is also support just under the breakdown @ 11.98.

For this guy, the breakdown is on a weekly close below **16.00** from there I am targeting 11.98, 7.59. to be conservative. Sure it can go lower, but pigs get slaughtered. So do retards, so do what you want. I'm not your financial advisor. For this one I'm looking at June 10 puts.

Next up is: $COIN

[$COIN 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5ohczjb52dt81.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1093669aaa2dd7724ea3fefcef5810c4aeba0ea1)

This is my least favorite for a few reasons:

1. It slopes downwards, this means you get a worse margin of error on the play.
2. No confluence.
3. It's not nearly as shitty of a company as the others.

Still, it's playable. For this one, you want a weekly close below 141.70 for entry. Keep in mind this will slope down every single week. From there, I would target 100.00 or so. I'd use June 120 puts to do so.

Last but not the least shitty, we have: $MARA

[$MARA 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/b9w9urtr2dt81.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d24ea8b574a05c3c4971365eb63361df7f2572)

Actually I like this setup the second most. Confluence with the breakdown and 19.25. Subsequently, you want a weekly close under 19.25 to enter this one. From there I would target 14.70 and 6.94. I'd use June 15 puts to do so.

\---

Annnd that's it. I know you fucks can't read, but **I haven't entered positions in any of these yet and am waiting for the entry triggers I posted to do so.** Never underestimate shit companies, they can do crazy things. I mean you had these things at prices 4-5x as high not too long ago.

so i don't get the chance to get out much or buy anything really, stay at home kinda guy, but i was quite thirsty and hungry and no one was home to drive me. So i walked to the corner store and grabbed one of my favorite drinks, went to the guy at the front and he informed me that he had no tyson chicken tenders, just stupid boneless chicken wings, so i said just the drink.

now, this drink is an Arizona ice tea, they have it on the can that says ""great buy .99c"" and he asked me for $1.06, that was way more, but i get it inflation i said and paid.

so I crunched some numbers and came up with like 6 to 7 percent based on the calculator I used on my emergency's only phone. the drink I bought was more than what I used to pay so inflation is clearly around 6-7%. Its not that bad guys.

so people are probably right here, inflation numbers are wrong, anyway ill take a number 7, and i hope you got someone ready for me, been a long week of losing money."

So i walked to the corner store and grabbed one of my favorite drinks, went to the guy at the front and he informed me that he had no tyson chicken tenders, just stupid chicken wings, so i said just the drink.

now, this drink is an Arizona ice tea, they have it on the can that says ""great buy .99c"" and he asked me for $1.06, that was way more, but i get it inflation i said and paid.  

so I crunched some numbers and came up with like  6 to 7 percent based on the calculator I used on my emergency's only phone. the drink I bought was more than what I used to pay so inflation is clearly around 6-7%. Its not that bad guys.

&amp;#x200B;

so people are probably right here, inflation numbers are wrong, anyway ill take a number 7, and i hope you got someone ready for me, been a long week of losing money."

wallstreetbet,"$ARQQ: The downside is it sounds like ARKK. The upside is small float, high CTB, high OI, and under the radar waiting for buying pressure.Alright, dweebs. You probably think you caught on to something pretty good with $ARQQ when u/Schumilex5 dropped [this DD earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u2r8uu/arqq_ultimate_gamma_squeeze_with_massive_oi_and/). You probably didn‚Äôt read it. But the row of awards and grip of retarded comments were enough to dip your toe in the water. I‚Äôve been working on a DD on $ARQQ for about a week and now that its cover is blown, it‚Äôs ready for your bloodshot jaundice eyes. 

So let‚Äôs take a look at what else we‚Äôve got with $ARQQ and get ready to eat this stock out like a club sandwich that is too tall to bite vertically.

**THE FLOAT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN YOU THINK:**

u/Schumilex5 mentioned in earlier DD that there isn‚Äôt a lock up in play, which was the plan according to the original prospectus. But, the tendie gods at ARQQ HQ [slipped us a little something back in October](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001859690/000110465921122323/tm2127896d4_6k.htm) that totally changed the game:

&gt;*On October 4, 2021, the Sponsor, the Arqit Limited Shareholders and their transferees, agreed to amend and restate the Original Lock-Up Agreements, and have agreed not to transfer any ordinary shares of the Company received pursuant to the Business Combination during the period commencing from the date of the closing of the Business Combination until the earlier to occur of (i) 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the close of trading on the second full trading day following the public dissemination by the Company of its financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2022 by press release to the national wire services or by making a filing with the SEC; and (ii) such time as determined by the board of directors of the Company as being in the best interest of the parties to permit transfers (the ‚ÄúNew Lock-Up Agreements‚Äù).*

They extended the lockup agreement until the results through March 31 2022 are **released**. We don‚Äôt know when that might be yet. But, if history is any indicator, it was December 16 2021 that they released their results for the period ending Sept 30 2021. **We‚Äôre still under lockup and will be for at least the next few weeks.**

**What does that mean for the float?**

Shit son, I‚Äôm glad you asked. It turns out that this De-SPAC hasn‚Äôt had diddly-poop for volume because there aren‚Äôt many shares available for public trading. Let‚Äôs break it down:

**Currently there are 120,073,430 shares outstanding.** That is 110,073,430 as of the last filing + a note indicated in subsequent events that another 10,000,000 were issued as part of the earn out agreement for the merger. That sounds like a lot‚Ä¶ but it isn‚Äôt shit today when we pull away everything locked up.

 [Check this from the last prospectus update on the offering:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001859690/000110465921153183/tm2135138-4_424b3.htm) 

https://preview.redd.it/c2yeyynzkct81.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88cd90ee87d213047d8ee8ae8481574d737e5476

**First, let‚Äôs cover the 10 million earn out shares issued after this last Prospectus:**

&gt;***Issuance of Earnout Shares***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination, if at any time during the three years following the closing of the Business Combination, the closing price of the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares during such period was equal to or exceeded $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period (the ‚ÄúEarnout Condition‚Äù), the Arqit Limited Shareholders were entitled to be issued a further 10,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company (the ‚ÄúEarnout Shares‚Äù). On October 5, 2021 the Earnout Condition was met, and therefore on October 6, 2021, the Earnout Shares were issued to the Arqit Limited Shareholders.* ***The Earnout Shares are subject to the Amended and Restated Lock-Up Agreements.***

**Done. 10,000,000 gone. 110,073,430 to go.** 

Next, who is subject to the lock up that was extended:

&gt;***Amended and Restated Lock-Up Agreements***  
&gt;  
&gt;*In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company entered into lock-up agreements* ***with Centricus Heritage, LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù) and the former shareholders of Arqit Limited (the ‚ÄúArqit Limited Shareholders‚Äù) (the ‚ÄúOriginal Lock-Up Agreements‚Äù).***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Pursuant to the Original Lock-Up Agreements, the Sponsor and the Arqit Limited Shareholders had agreed not to transfer any ordinary shares of the Company received pursuant to the Business Combination during the period commencing from the date of the closing of the Business Combination until the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the closing price of the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares during such period exceeded $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period and (ii) 18 months after the closing of the Business Combination.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*On October 4, 2021, the Sponsor, the Arqit Limited Shareholders and their transferees, agreed to amend and restate the Original Lock-Up Agreements, and agreed not to transfer any ordinary shares of the Company received pursuant to the Business Combination during the period commencing from the date of the closing of the Business Combination until the earlier to occur of (i) 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the close of trading on the second full trading day following the public dissemination by the Company of its financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2022; and (ii) such time as determined by the board of directors of the Company as being in the best interest of the parties to permit transfers (the ‚ÄúAmended and Restated Lock-Up Agreements‚Äù).*  
&gt;  
&gt;***In addition to the Sponsor and the Arqit Limited Shareholders, Heritage Assets SCSP entered into an Amended and Restated Lock-Up Agreement with respect to 1,825,096 shares assigned to it by the Arqit Limited Shareholders at the time of the closing of the Business Combination, which were previously subject to an Original Lock-Up Agreement.***

So we‚Äôve got *Centricus Heritage LLC* locked up. Go up to the share count table above and that‚Äôs the *Centricus Initial Shareholders.* **They‚Äôve got 8,625,000 shares and they can‚Äôt sell a goddam one of them right now.** 

Next is on the agreement is *Arqit Limited Shareholders,* who holds...where is it again‚Ä¶ **88,174,904 more shares that are off limits. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF**

Then we‚Äôve also got this little guy at the bottom *Heritage Assets SC.* **Their 1,825,096 shares are also subject to the revised lockup.**

Quick tally on where we stand so far:

**110,073,430 minus:**

**8,625,000** from Centricus initial shareholders

**88,174,904** from the Arquit limited shareholders

**1,825,096** from Heritage Asset SCSP

Remain float shares: **11,448,430** 

At 11.4 million things are looking a little spicier. If it weren‚Äôt for those 7.1 million PIPE shares, we would be in low float nirvana. But I didn‚Äôt read 2,000 pages of SEC filings to leave you hanging with some ‚Äòif only‚Äô bullshit. **Who are the PIPE investors?**

&gt;***PIPE Subscription Agreements***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Centricus and Arqit entered into the Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and Arqit agreed to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors, an aggregate of 7,100,000 ordinary shares at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $71,000,000 immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination.* ***The PIPE Investors include Garth Ritchie, a current director of Centricus and who became a director of Arqit upon completion of the Business Combination, and Cristina Levis, an executive officer of Centricus, each of whom invested $500,000 in the PIPE Financing. The PIPE Investors also include Heritage Assets SCSP, which invested $50,000,000 in the PIPE Financing. Mr. Lefebvre d‚ÄôOvidio has sole investment and voting power over the shares held by Heritage Assets SCSP and is a director of Centricus and became a director of Arqit upon completion of the Business Combination. Arqit has granted the PIPE Investors certain registration rights in connection with the PIPE Financing.***

Remember that it isn‚Äôt just locked up shares that get pulled from the float. We also remove those owned by board members and other insiders. **5.1 million of the 7.1 million PIPE shares are owned by current directors of Arquit and are not part of the publically trading float.** 

**11,448,430 from above less 5,100,000 PIPE shares leaves: 6,348,430 floating shares.**

https://preview.redd.it/kwvzfnz3mct81.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f51d4b1f9c7fb75ee6134323033e8f3df451f1d

Don‚Äôt forget about our guy Mr. Lefebvre d‚ÄôOvidio from the PIPE above. It turns out we see his name again further down the filing for another tranche of shares. 

&gt;***Business combination agreement***  
&gt;  
&gt;*On May 12, 2021, Centricus Acquisition Corp. (‚ÄúCentricus‚Äù/ ‚ÄúCAC‚Äù), Arqit Limited (‚ÄúAL‚Äù), and the shareholders of AL entered into a Business Combination Agreement whereby: (i) on September 2, 2021, Centricus merged with and into Arqit Quantum Inc (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù / ‚ÄúAQI‚Äù), with the Company surviving the merger, and the security holders of Centricus became security holders of the Company, and (ii) on September 3, 2021, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding share capital of AL from the shareholders of AL in exchange for ordinary shares of the Company, such that AL is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In consideration for the merger between the Company and Centricus, each Centricus shareholder received one  ordinary share and one warrant of the Company for each ordinary share and warrant they held in Centricus, respectively. Each ordinary share of AL was acquired by the Company in exchange for 46.06 ordinary shares of AQI.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Prior to the merger of the Company with Centricus, Heritage Assets SCSp purchased 2,200,000 Class A Ordinary Shares of Centricus in open-market transactions for a cash consideration of $22,000,000 and, as an incentive to Heritage Assets SCSp for such purchase, Centricus and certain shareholders of AL transferred to Heritage Assets SCSp an aggregate of 1,825,096 Ordinary Shares in the Company as part of the recapitalisation.***

It turns out his 1,825,096 shares from the very first section were given to him because he saved the SPAC deal when too many shareholders tried to redeem their shares for NAV. **He bought 2,200,000 of the Centricus public shares and pledged not to redeem them in exchange for a big fucking freebie of another 1.8 million shares. Great deal for Mr. Lefebvre d‚ÄôOvidio, but great deal for apes too. 2.2 million of the 4.34 million publically trading shares are removed from the float since they are owned by an entity controlled by a current board member.**

Where does that leave us: **4,148,430 public float on ARQQ**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mj2nwxaamct81.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=086da4c74f32a1ce53a32898132499b616fdace2

With a float of just over 4.1 million and much more open interest on the April and May options contracts, go back and re-read the original gamma squeeze DD with this new information. Fucking beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?

Better still: This new float number changes the context of a short squeeze dramatically. Take a look at the most recent exchange reported data and today‚Äôs Ortex estimated data:

https://preview.redd.it/ytx2wiybmct81.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a5d71f628d45dd2162c4572ee1f61d3da9c1295

**Now with a short interest of 1.6 million shares we are looking at a short interest of nearly 40% of the float and a CTB of 200%. This squeeze is dual threat. Shorts are fukked. Market makers are fukked.** 

Why does every other data collector and aggregator out there show a much higher float of over 20 million and a crayon eater on Reddit has to dig this out of a fucking file box worth of filing documents?

**Float is not an ‚Äòofficially‚Äô tracked metric.** It generally defined as the share count available to openly trade in the public. **But search in any company‚Äôs SEC filings and you won‚Äôt find a reported float number or breakdown of how they get to that number.** 

We rely on companies like S3, Ortex, Capital IQ and others to do their own due diligence to make sure they are counting shares correctly as floating, or not floating. Unfortunately, without regulation on the matter, most of them are using scraping and algorithms on the text in filings to try to back out the non-floating shares and then minimal human intervention supervises the results and calls it good. 

As you can see from our above analysis to arrive at the true float, no algo today would be able to piece all of this together on its own. The 1,000+ pages of filings needed to do it manually are much more than those companies are going to pay an analyst to beat their face against for a week. They aren‚Äôt nearly as retarded as a desperate WSB shill. I digress.

**Warrants:**

We've got a nice low float. But these little shits always pop up and dilute at the worst possible time when a despac is making a run. **I don't expect them to be a big problem for ARQQ in the immediate squeezeable future.** 

We‚Äôve got private warrants and public warrants with ARQQ. The first step is easy. There are 6,266,667 private placement warrants outstanding and they are all owned by Centricus Heritage LLC, the sponsor of the deal:

&gt;*Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 6,266,667 warrants (the ‚ÄúPrivate Placement Warrants‚Äù) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Centricus Heritage LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù), generating gross proceeds of $9,400,000, which is described in Note 4.* 

They are part of the lock up agreement. They are insiders. **They are not float if/when they are redeemed.** 

Then we‚Äôve got public warrants. There are 8.6 million of these floating around under the ticker symbol ARQQW. Those might seem like an imminent dilution bomb. But it might not be as dire as it seems.

***This section more rooted in my personal opinion than hard facts as we cannot know for certain when or how the warrants might be exercised. I present my own argument. Draw your own conclusions.***

The warrants offer a right to buy one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. As I write this, the warrants last traded at $3.96 per share. To buy a warrant today and redeem it would cost you $15.46 per share. With the underlying common shares at $14.57, you can see how warrants redemptions are not a quick flip investment in most cases. It can also be capital intensive compared to other shorter duration derivatives like call options and the liquidity of the public options can be spotty if you want to trade them actively. So how do I foresee these options converting if many won‚Äôt be explicitly exercised by traders in the near term? And when might it happen?

I believe the company will take care of that for us with a forced redemption. **And better still, it won‚Äôt be in the immediate future and it could be for far fewer shares than 8.1 million.** 

A provision in the warrants allows the company to ‚Äòforce‚Äô the redemption of the warrants under the following conditions:

&gt;¬∑ *Upon minimum of 30 days‚Äô prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and*  
&gt;  
&gt;¬∑ *If, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.*

That helps us answer when. The share price will have to be over $18 for at least 20 trading days **THEN** a 30 notice of redemption is sent **THEN** the warrants will be redeemed. **The important part: A forced redemption is at minimum two months away.** 

The redemption can be done one of two ways: cash or cashless. The company has reserved the right to opt for either in the warrant agreements. What is the difference? 

¬∑ **In a cash redemption:** the warrant holder sends ARQQ $11.50 in cash and in turn receives one share of stock. Pretty straight forward.

¬∑ **In a cashless redemption:** the middleman cash transaction is cut out and instead the company transfers the warrant holder a fraction of a share of stock equal to the profit they would have had in a cash transaction. To calculate this fractional share, they use a complex options pricing calculation assuming volatility and time until the warrant expired. For ARQQ that redemption table looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vsuvwhpmct81.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e196f108e78d4763b9af1fb7e0695e288aa8636f

**0.361 shares per warrant is the maximum share issuance in a cashless redemption.** If ARQQ meets the requirements to redeem all of the warrants, I believe they will choose to do so in the more shareholder friendly cashless basis. Why?

* They have stated that the cash received from their IPO is more than enough to fund the product development and business plan
* Without a need for cash, the company can reduce dilution by redeeming warrants for fractional shares
* The company just recently went post revenue and with a large sales pipeline, should reduce their cash burn rate quickly

It is impossible to know what warrant holders will choose to do with organically requesting redemption or what management will choose to do if given the opportunity to redeem all warrants. But there is a window of opportunity for fractional redemptions that could reduce the 8.1 million outstanding public warrants to less than 4 million shares of dilution. To top it off, it would be far enough away that the lockup period has likely past and the squeeze has already squozen.

**The company is an interesting long even without a squeeze:**

I‚Äôve already blown up the scroll bar hard enough, so I‚Äôll save you some time here and keep it shortish:

Quantum computers are coming and they could quickly become extremely powerful. The brute force of quantum computers could quickly overwhelm existing algorithms and technology for generating hashing and encryption. ARQQ offers a product aimed at ‚Äòquantum-proofing‚Äô hashing and other security sensitive ‚Äòbrute forceable‚Äô infrastructure. 

You can get a more technical sense of the problems the company is working to solve in their own words [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001859690/000110465921093381/tm2122531d1_425.htm). It is all abstract and a bit of a stretch for me to fully grasp what they are doing and I consider myself relatively technically literate. Some numbers that turned me on to ARQQ as a possible long despite this futuristic new product are in their early sales numbers:

&gt;*As of September 30, 2021, Arqit‚Äôs backlog estimates consisted of approximately $130 million in customer contracts, and Arqit had an estimated $1.1 billion in pipeline.*

**That $130 million in contracts figure is now more than 6 months old and has very likely grown. It was also driven by a sales staff of just two (one dedicated sales person and the CEO).** The company has indicated that the proceeds of its IPO will help it not only deliver its products to market, but to build up the sales and marketing muscle to dominate this new space.

The company just went post revenue in just the last days of their last reporting period, which is why you see a paltry 5-figure revenue for that period. With the next earnings release coming likely in May, we will be able to get a much clearer idea of the pace at which ARQQ will be able to beef up that sales pipeline and convert it in to revenue. It is highly speculative. But at a $1.6 billion valuation today, you might think about holding on to some of this one. Even if there is a gamma/short squeeze scenario in the coming weeks.

**TLDR; There was a DD for $ARQQ** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u2r8uu/arqq_ultimate_gamma_squeeze_with_massive_oi_and/)**. It‚Äôs pretty awesome, right? But the float on ARQQ is actually tiny compared to published data. The gamma squeeze is that much stronger for the case made in the DD.** 

**Short % of float could be in the range of 40% based on this new float number of 4.14 million shares. With a CTB of 200%+ on Ortex and 160%+ on iBorrow, this would be one of the top short squeezes on retail‚Äôs radar if it wasn‚Äôt for cucks at the data aggregators being lazy assholes that publish incorrect data.** 

**It‚Äôs actually a pretty fucking cool company with a robust sales pipeline. Keep them on your watchlist, even if you don‚Äôt want to get degen with us and play the squeezes.**

Not financial advice, I researched and wrote this myself, check my work for yourself before acting on it. Peace, love, and large sums of money.

**Positions: 300 ARQQ shares, 5/20 $10c and 5/20 15c, 500 ARQQW warrants just to take some out of circulation.**"

This link has more information, including some estimates from analysts. This was updated fairly recently, after the last quarterly report and guidance was released, and they are expecting continued growth this year.

&amp;#x200B;

[Another fair value calculation. This one was done a little bit earlier before the stock fell below $10.](https://preview.redd.it/4izq3nb07ct81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42f480643b3e94027542cee9f75ad3fc500659d7)

Here is an excerpt from a more recent valuation done just last month:

&gt;Weber Inc. reported strong momentum in the last quarterly report. Management also announced changes in its manufacturing and transportation processes to fight any future supply chain issue. With recent acquisitions and a new manufacturing hub in Europe, I would be expecting both inorganic and organic growth. In sum, under the best-case scenario, I believe that Weber's fair price could stand at approximately $30. I would expect certain risks, but the downside risk does seem limited.

$30 is most bullish, everything goes right valuation. What he deems to be the most likely fair value today is $15 per share, 50% higher than today's price.

*This came from an SA article that I am not allowed to link. I think the information from this specific article is very valid though. The author included bearish arguments, but believes the base case of 15 is the most likely. Copy and paste that into google to find the full article with the different cases laid out if you want more info since I can't provide a direct link.*

What appears to be the biggest flaw with this play is share dilution. Looking at their recent filings shows diluted shares outstanding of 287 million, about 5 times more than the current shares outstanding of 53 million (again, float of just 16.7 million shares). However, these are not shares that are ready to be sold to the public, they are ""Class B"" common stock and LLC units issued to some of the pre-IPO investors. They can be converted to Class A common stock, which is tradable, but they have to request this redemption.

pulled from the latest 10Q:

&gt;There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Weber HoldCo LLC, each holder of non-voting common interest units of Weber HoldCo LLC (""LLC Units"") has the right to require Weber HoldCo LLC to redeem all or a portion of its LLC Units for, at the Company‚Äôs election, newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A Common Stock for each LLC Unit redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). Additionally, in the event of a redemption request by a holder of LLC Units, the Company may, at its option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A Common Stock for LLC Units in lieu of such a redemption. A corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock will be canceled on a one-for-one basis if the Company or Weber HoldCo LLC, following a redemption request of a holder of LLC Units, redeems or exchanges LLC Units of such holder of LLC Units. (Page 45)

The diluted weighted average shares outstanding of Class A common stock includes the effects of the if-converted method to reflect the assumed exchange of all Paired Interests on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock in Weber Inc. (Item 13)

Shares of Class B common stock do not share in earnings and are not participating securities. (Item 13)

The diluted shares outstanding on their income statement is the Class B common stock. As of the date the report was filed, none of these shares have been redeemed, so the float and basic shares outstanding should be about the same (give or take a small amount gifted via RSU grants, which has no impact on the float). Because they have to request they be redeemed, so far nobody has requested this redemption, and they ""**are NOT participating securities,""** dilution should not be an issue for a squeeze play. They can request a redemption at anytime, but there is  a 1-5 business day delay from similar redemption forms I've been able to find. I could not find one giving the specific time frame for WEBR.

The float can be calculated using Ortex's short interest estimation, but here is a link for it:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/webr](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/webr)

This is a company with a float of only 16.7 million shares (less than most of the previous squeeze plays we've seen lately), has 40% of that shorted, is expected to continue growing, has an estimated fair value about 50% higher than today's price, and is heading into their best season of the year. This stock has been heavily shorted for months, but now we are heading into their peak season, and the only thing keeping this stock from squeezing is volume.

wallstreetbet,"$CCMP CMC Materials, Inc., a brief look into this semi-conductor stock with an upcoming acquisition by Entegris (ENTG)This DD is my own research, some parts are closer to the sources than others. I reference the sources below each section, and also quoted some parts of articles. **This is essentially an arbitage play, there is also an upcoming dividend:**

* **‚ÄôUnder the terms of the agreement, CMC Materials shareholders will receive $133.00 in cash and 0.4506 shares of Entegris common stock for each share of CMC Materials common stock they own. The total per share consideration represents a 35% premium over CMC Materials.**
* **‚ÄòCCMP will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.46, payable on 4/22/22.  As a percentage of CCMP's recent stock price of $186.25, this dividend works out to approximately 0.25%.‚Äô**

**What is CCMP?**

CMC Materials, Inc., provides consumable materials to semiconductor manufacturers, and pipeline and adjacent industry consumers. It operates in two segments, those being Electronic Materials and Performance Materials. The Electronic Materials segment develops, produces and sells chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries for polishing various materials used in IC devices (e.g. tungsten and copper. As well as various materials used in the production of disk substrates and magnetic heads for hard disk drives, and CMP pads (which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process. This segment also offers a variety of blends of chemicals and speciality organic solvents; and also develops and manufactures consumable products for cleaning advanced probe cards and test sockets. 

The Performance Materials segment provides pipeline and industrial materials used in the crude oil industry, as well as related services and equipment, and routine and emergency maintenance services, as well as training services. It also offers precision polishing and metrology systems for advanced optics applications, polishing fluids, consumables, spare and replacement parts, as well as optical polishing services and other customer support services. It also engages in the wood treatment business.

The company was formerly known as Cabot Microelectronics Corporation and changed its name to CMC Materials, Inc. in Oct 2020. It was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Aurora, Illinois.

**Ex-Dividend**
&gt;‚ÄòCCMP will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.46, payable on 4/22/22.  As a percentage of CCMP's recent stock price of $186.25, this dividend works out to approximately 0.25%.‚Äô

Looking at the one year chart, CCMP‚Äôs low point in its 52 range is $119.19 per share, with $198.605 being its 52 week high point. 

(Nasdaq)

Investors of record on Wednesday March 23rd, will be paid this dividend on Friday April 22nd. This represents a $1.84 annual dividend with a yield of 1.01%. The company has raised its dividend by 4.8% over the last three years, and has increased its dividend every year for the last 4 years. Its dividend is sufficiently covered by earnings, with a dividend payout ratio of 22.3%. 
As analysts predict the company to earn $8.19 per share next year, the company should be able to continue to cover its $1.84 annual dividend with an expected future payout ratio of 22.5%
(marketbeat)

**Earnings**

Earnings were last released on Wednesday Feb 2nd. CCMP reported $2.06 earnings per share for the quarter, which beat analysts‚Äô consensus estimates of $1.75 by $0.31. It had a negative net margin of 5.91%, and a positive return on equity of 22.85%. Revenues were $317.05 million for the quarter, again beating analyst estimates of $316.50 million. 

For the same quarter last year, CCMP reported $1.92 earnings per share. 

‚ÄôOn average, equities research analysts predict that CMC Materials will post 7.45 earnings per share for the current year.‚Äô

**Recent Analyst comments**
I saw no point rewriting this so I‚Äôm quoting marketbeat here:
&gt;‚ÄôA number of equities analysts have recently commented on the stock. Citigroup raised shares of CMC Materials from a ""sell"" rating to a ""neutral"" rating and lifted their target price for the company from $130.00 to $200.00 in a report on Friday, December 17th.

**Entegris Merger**

The stock has risen more than 35% over the past six months. This is a good momentum, and the company started March with further good news. 
‚ÄôThe company announced that its stockholders had approved the previously announced merger agreement. Under which, Entegris (NASDAQ: ENTG) will acquire CMC Materials in a cash and stock transaction.‚Äô

(StockMarket)

&gt;‚ÄôAurora, IL, March 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CMC Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: CCMP), a leading global supplier of consumable materials primarily to semiconductor manufacturers, announced that at today‚Äôs special meeting its stockholders voted to approve the previously announced merger agreement, under which Entegris, Inc. (Nasdaq: ENTG) will acquire CMC Materials in a cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion at announcement.

&gt;Preliminary voting results indicate that the merger agreement proposal was approved by approximately 84% of the outstanding shares of CMC Materials common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting of stockholders. The final voting results of the special meeting, as tabulated by an independent inspector of elections, will be filed by the company as part of a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù). **The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.**‚Äô

(Yahoo)

&gt;‚ÄôUnder the terms of the agreement, CMC Materials shareholders will receive $133.00 in cash and 0.4506 shares of Entegris common stock for each share of CMC Materials common stock they own. The total per share consideration represents a 35% premium over CMC Materials‚Äô closing price on December 14, 2021, and a 38% premium to the 10-day volume weighted average share price. Upon completion of the transaction, Entegris shareholders will own approximately 91% of the combined company and CMC Materials shareholders will own approximately 9%.‚Äô

(businesswire)

**Conclusion/TL;DR:**

I don‚Äôt want to make this DD too long like my others, so I‚Äôm going to end my research here.
Overall I think this is a good play for shares. The stock price of CCMP will be somewhat tied to the $133 per share cash combined with the value of Entegris stock, which you will recieve upon completion of the deal. There is also the upcoming ex-dividend which may drive up the price of the stock. There is also the However CCMP seems to be an interesting stock on its own, so I‚Äôm interested to see how things will turn out when acquired by Entegris. I might write a part 2 with research on Entegris. If you know any more information about this stock (CCMP or Entegris) feel free to comment."

This morning around I believe it was 11am I was looking at my charts and noticed while we sat near 374 and had only seen a HOD of 377 that the daily range was already saying we had touched 380.53. I thought that was odd. I checked the daily candle and sure enough‚Ä¶ it looked like we touched 380.53. I thought well that‚Äôs odd so I checked TOS and webull and they said the same thing! We had only see $4.44 of movement but they were telling us we had seen nearly $8 of movement‚Ä¶ And my initial thoughts were a glitch or I miss a 1minute candle blip. Nope all clean and PM never even broke 380. 

So of course I first thoughts are we are going to see then run it to 380.53 range before they dump it‚Ä¶ and what did they do? They ran it to 380.66 and IMMEDIATELY reversed it. I don‚Äôt know what kind of market fuckery that is right there but I have NEVER EVER seen anything like that before. 

https://preview.redd.it/m3b8zyfxvt891.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f0130b45f3d56dca49c56e953be9d2436a6c869

Are we having fun yet? Are we enjoying 2022 day/ swing trading? 

The coolest thing about today was watching JPM close out near $1.3 billion in profit on their collar today and open their near September collar. 

https://preview.redd.it/1gv0b6qyvt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63056f7395bad69eeb6a7655bd4dcd076c3d81b4

JPM is saying we wont break about 400 SPY (doubtful we fill the gap now at 410.5) and we should see about a 5% drop to 360 SPY and we are positioned for about 300 SPY worst case scenario. 

So with this information lets take a look at the daily and clean it up a little. 

https://preview.redd.it/x3xec2hzvt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e63aae5f959c1c0b7da3f12c48a2735b1b934c

We are holding the black channel support so far. I suspect us to break through that black dotted support line of 373 tomorrow. 

We now have a red dotted bear channel forming.

https://preview.redd.it/lpy24o30wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c3dbc549c97d2344064c4c9740351b28d4f0e84

If you note on the daily using the black solid line and the red dotted support line we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge which means we just might see that 300 price target by end of July if things don‚Äôt improve. But we are on a clear path to 358 SPY right now. 

https://preview.redd.it/cf4p55r0wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5453ff594b8e0b9e6163ded15551a6ee3f7c416

The weekly chart is what interests me the most‚Ä¶ we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge forming there with the floor near that 350-358 price range for next week. I have a feeling now that we 1. Rejected breaking through weekly 8ema and 2. Broke down out of blue bull channel we are going to start our next sell off. 

We have been seeing for about the last 6 months now that the last week or first week of a month we get a change of trend‚Ä¶ we are now due for a sell off. 

As much as I would love to say this is the time to go long 60-90dte puts I just don‚Äôt think it is‚Ä¶

What I think we are going to see is that SPY is going to trade between 360-380 until end of July. End of July bring a shit storm of things for us. 

We have Junes FOMC minutes releasing July 6th,  CPI on July 13th, FOMC on July 27th, GDP on July 29th (which most likely will be negative and confirm a recession), and then we also start earnings around the 2nd to 3rd week of July. 

I have a feeling earnings are gonna be dog water and with this last two weeks of July shit storm brewing we MIGHT have one more bull week or at least sideways week left in us before we finally see capitulation and get the next move down with a  price target of 300 SPY by September. 

10% challenge-

After having a killer week in theory that I turned into a shit week by failing to take profits all week out of pure greed I refused to do that today. Had a great day for sure. 

https://preview.redd.it/3v8at4f2wt891.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b3b215780207a2910d530a4714c18fc354fc8a0

My ONLY saltiness about today is I KNEW we were going to sell off EOD when we kept rejecting off of 380 but I was too scared to enter after yesterdays fuckery. I finally entered and had a position up about 40%... I decided to lock in a 25% stop limit sell order on the 0dte JUST IN CASE she turned against me. But I had VERY VERY strong intuition she was gonna see 100%+ profits‚Ä¶ Well she triggered at 32% as you can see above in my log. I then only had $26 in BP left so I bought a 0dte 373 to let ride and of course as you can see within 4 minutes it was up well over 100%... It hit 150% at its peak. Had I just held on and believed I would have had 100%+ profits. 

But that‚Äôs how this market goes. The days we don‚Äôt secure profits like I did today or at least protect us from the downside is the days we get absolutely rocked like I did yesterday. And the days we do take profits are the days it perfectly hits our PT. The 11.4% and 10.7% I played earlier were the same thing a 10% stop limit just in case that triggered and both those went to see 100-200% gains also. This market is such a mind fuck on being able to trust the chart and indicators but also protecting yourself from tom-foolery.

wallstreetbet,"Lehman 2.0: How SocGen and Credit Suisse Will Bring Down the Financial System  

Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, or SocGen, and Credit Suisse hold over $2.5 trillion (USD) in assets and are two of the top banks in Europe. Both are part of Tier-1 of the G-SIBs, or Globally Systematic Important Banks (alongside Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and others, just to give some perspective on size and importance. The G-SIBs rankings were established in 2011, and mean that these banks are essentially to big to fail, until they do.

We will start with the big picture. European banks in general are under critical stress. The Euro is collapsing, energy prices are skyrocketing, and assets held within Russia are largely lost forever.   On top of this, the European Central Bank (ECB) is raising rates for the first time in over a decade. Let me make it clear that there was a reason Europe decided to go to negative rate territory. If they had not, there would have been mass defaults, a major recession, and there would have essentially been no recovery from the Financial Crisis. The whole Euro Zone would have been decimated. Maybe something positive would have come out of this, maybe not, but leaders in Europe and the ECB decided to sacrifice the future for the present, and unfortunately now we are in the future.

SocGen has always had significantly risky practices, ala Lehman Brothers[. In fact, Lehman said in January 2008 that the fraud uncovered at SocGen was ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs worst nightmare.‚Äù ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-socgen-lehman-1/socgen-case-everyones-worst-nightmare-lehman-ceo-idUSFLE43779720080124) Irony abounds. Following this, [SocGen absorbed a bunch of ex-Lehman staff](https://www.fx-markets.com/people/1555950/ex-lehman-fx-sales-team-reunited-at-socgen) and continued what they do best: overleveraging, defrauding, and [money laundering](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-11-30/u-s-ends-societe-generale-sanctions-case-after-bank-complies-with-agreement) for the world‚Äôs elite criminals. This kind of business model works well when it is working, but when a perfect storm hits, it‚Äôs an absolute fiasco. 

Credit Suisse is not much different. [This article from February pretty much sums up everything you need to know about Credit Suisse.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians) As if we are living in a sick joke, they named Axel Lehmann their head of their risk committee last year, who is now their chairman. Unlike US banks which recovered after the financial crisis, Credit Suisse is still down 92% from the highs and is down over 40% this year. SocGen has had a similar downwards trajectory.

Now, onto the perfect storm. Since January 2021, the Euro is down 12% against the USD. That may not seem like a lot, but you must understand that currency markets move very slowly until something is fundamentally wrong on one side of the currency pair.  Currency traders use significant leverage (sometimes as much as 1000:1) to make trades, and multi-percent moves can cause a lot of collateral damage. Fast-forward to 2022 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Credit Suisse, SocGen, and essentially every other bank in Europe had significant risk exposure to Russia and Russian banks, as they all had done business on a regular basis. The sanctions that were put on Russia caused significant FX volatility along with a massive spike in energy prices, which both contributed to the energy inflation Europe is seeing which far outpaces the US. There was already some restructuring going on at Credit Suisse, which did not help. Here is a table for bank comparison:

Said bluntly, Credit Suisse is ALREADY operating at a deficit, before the ECB raises rates. The ECB raising rates will cause significant loan defaults. 

Now, for SocGen. I work with UHNW individuals and constantly price out structured products. Structured products are largely a game for the wealthy to ensure an income while limiting significant risk in the markets, but there is always counterparty risk. What this means is that banks write these structured products, and the risk premium is in part determined by the ability of the counterparty bank, the bank that is writing the note, staying solvent. When Lehman was nearing the end and internal employees knew it, they wrote a ton of notes such as principal protection notes that ‚Äúensured‚Äù investors could not lose, unless Lehman, a prestigious bank of over 150 years, went out of business.

Fastforward to last week. This hits my inbox at work. A note, written by SocGen, essentially guaranteeing a return over 20%

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what was written alongside this note:

Highest Max Return: **31.25%**

Lowest Max Return: **24.30%**

Underlying: **SPX**

Issuer: **Soc Gen**

Strike Date: **6/16**

Notional: **$1,000,000**

I have never seen a note like this hit my inbox, and I have already written previously about SocGen and its risky structured note behavior. It is coming full circle.

These businesses are going to get crushed over the next three months. What Europe is facing is much more dire than what the United States is facing; There are countries in Europe that can‚Äôt pay back their debt, never mind businesses and consumers. The ECB has to raise rates, if they do not inflation will topple governments. The challenge will be if the result becomes so unstable that the entire European Union collapses, and countries such as Germany return to their own currencies, sending the Euro spiraling downwards.

There are hundreds of other data points that should be in this report, and please feel free to comment with them because this is all beyond fascinating. 

**Puts, shorts, and anything else betting against Credit Suisse and SocGen are good plays, especially over the next six months.**

They credit the 4% increase in customers to more people visiting stores since the pandemic was over. This is an extremely lousy increase.

wallstreetbet,"US: CNYCF TSXV: SCLT - What are your thoughts on this Uranium Rare Earth play?Searchlight Resources: begins field work on RARE EARTH AND URANIUM TARGETS

**Highlights**

* Searchlight has been granted a permit for surface exploration at Kulyk Lake
* Field work follow-up of September 2021 radiometric survey
* Prospecting and grid sampling planned on previously unknown uranium zone
* Prospecting and grid sampling planned for 3-km Thorium / Rare Earth zone

Searchlight is well positioned for the coming summer season. The high-grade uranium discovery at Kulyk Lake have been tested with results pending. That alone could become a game-changer for the company. This is followed by the extremely high-grade rare earths also identified at Kulyk Lake.

In addition, Duddridge Lake also offers the best exploration opportunities. After all, Rio Tinto searches along the same structure nearby for the same Red Bed Copper deposits that Searchlight has detected. At the moment, Searchlight is only known to a small number of investors. With drilling success this summer, the company could easily succeed in any category, as a uranium explorer, as a rare earth explorer, or even a copper-cobalt explorer.

A
The latest price target for Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) was reported by JP Morgan on June 29, 2022. The analyst firm set a price target for $37.00 expecting LYFT to rise to within 12 months (a possible 178.61% upside). 47 analyst firms have reported ratings in the last year.

A
The latest analyst rating for Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) was provided by JP Morgan, and Lyft maintained their overweight rating.

When is the next analyst rating going to be posted or updated for Lyft (LYFT)?
A
Analysts arrive at stock ratings after doing extensive research, which includes going through public financial statements, talking to executives and customers of Lyft, and listening in to earnings conference calls. Most analysts do this every three months, so you should get 4 ratings per company per firm each year. The last rating for Lyft was filed on June 29, 2022 so you should expect the next rating to be made available sometime around June 29, 2023.

wallstreetbet,"WHO will declare Monkeypox a PHEIC by Sunday $BAVA FINAL DD**TLDR:**

**I believe the WHO will make Monkeypox a PHEIC by Sunday. $BAVA Bavarian Nordic Stock should at least get a nice bump. Once they have announced the PHEIC the stock will skyrocket as people will think this is Biontech 2.0 with COVID all over again.**

**If the spread continues and recent trends remain in place I think that risk groups in the population might be vaccinated in the US, Canada and Europe. Revenues could amount to 10b+ over the next years for $BAVA, the market cap is currently around 2b only.**

**The company additionally has a unique pipeline of other vaccines (see below)**

&amp;#x200B;

My first DD on Monkeypox was over a month ago. Since then $BAVA Bavarian Nordic's Stock has consistently moved upwards. Unfortunately, $EBS (I will explain later why) has not.

**Recent Events:**

* [Monkeypox continues to spread counting over 5000 cases now in 50 countries. When I wrote my first DD there were around 50 cases 4 weeks ago.](https://www.monkeypoxmeter.com/)
* The WHO held a meeting last weekend to analyse whether they should declare Monkeypox a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern). Result: [They did not, but they said they would closely watch data over the next weeks and reconvene if necessary](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/who-says-monkeypox-isn-e2-80-99t-a-global-health-emergency-yet-e2-80-94but-raises-e2-80-98serious-concerns-e2-80-99-about-spread/ar-AAYRXn3?ocid=BingNewsSearch).
* [Monkeypox continues to spread now in groups other than MSM ‚Äì in groups at high risk such as children and pregnant women](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/monkeypox-spilling-high-risk-groups-warns-who/)

Citing from the press release of WHO after the Meeting:

"" While a few Members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO Director-General that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute a PHEIC........ The Committee considered that the **occurrence of one or more of the following should prompt a re-assessment** of the event: evidence of an increase in the rate of growth of cases reported in the next 21 days, both among and beyond the population groups currently affected; occurrence of cases among sex workers; **evidence of significant spread** to and within additional countries, or significant increases in number of cases and spread in endemic countries; **increase in number of cases in vulnerable groups, such as immunosuppressed individuals**, including with poorly controlled HIV infection, **pregnant women, and children;** evidence of increased severity in reported cases (i.e. increased morbidity or mortality and rates of hospitalization; evidence¬†of reverse spillover to the animal population; **evidence of significant change in viral genome** associated with phenotypic changes, leading to enhanced transmissibility, virulence or properties of immune escape, or resistance to antivirals, and reduced impact of countermeasures; evidence of cluster of cases associated with clades of greater virulence detected in new countries outside West and Central African countries.""

Why would they reconvene the PHEIC meeting?

As they said above they would reconsider their judgement when different events occur.

* **We have the spread among children now and also continuously rising case numbers MUCH higher than last week --&gt; increase in number of cases in vulnerable groups**
* **A study found that the virus has probably mutated (around 50 mutations)**
* **Normally you would not expect many mutations for this type of virus so this is more than 6 times the normal --&gt; evidence of significant change in viral genome**
* [Read it here](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/mutations-in-virus-causing-monkeypox-outbreak-allow-it-to-spread-more-easily-363135)
* There are models that point to significant growth in the numbers worldwide if the virus is not stopped
* We have spread among endemic countries in Africa
* **I believe these are enough reasons for the WHO to reconvene and announce a PHEIC**
* &amp;#x200B;

**Actions by Governments:**

[The US has released 300.000 vaccines from its vaccine reserve against Monkeypox. There will be much more cases going into the winter, more than a million doses will be ready soon.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/28/us-to-deploy-nearly-300000-monkeypox-vaccine-doses-to-fight-outbreak.html)

It was not the vaccine made by $EBS, because the side effects are pretty heavy ‚Äì this was used decades ago to eliminate Smallpox and the risk / reward of this vaccine was much better back then than it is today. I was wrong on this one, they still have the antiviral treatment, but I dont think mass use of their vaccine will become reality.

Today I believe all countries will prefer the use of $BAVA‚Äôs JYNNEOS vaccine. [Also in the EU it is the preferred solution.](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/monkeypox-vaccine-maker-bavarian-nordic-054717749.html).

# Investment Case:

$BAVA has a production capacity of around 30 million doses per year.

I believe they will roll out vaccines for groups at high risk quite soon - but only when the vaccine will be available in larger numbers for governments worldwide - otherwise this might cause panic in the population:

* Pregnant Women
* Kids
* MSM, LGTBQ+ Community
* Healthcare workers

Based on data from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/6466/europes-lgbt-population-mapped/) I would assume a conservative 6% of the population in the US and Europe are LGBTQ+.  Europe has a population of roughly 740m people, Canada and the US around 360m, that is over 1b people.

600m alone are in the LGBTQ+ group. I would assume a low vaccination rate of 10% initially. That would be 60m people with 120m vaccine doses. The cost of two doses will most likely go up from the 60 USD that I have researched before, let's say to 80 USD - that would be 4.8b USD in revenue at a market cap of roughly 2.3b.

[**The CDC currently says they are considering the vaccine for kids as well**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cdc-eyes-bavarian-monkeypox-vaccine-for-kids-as-outbreak-spreads-1.1783150)**.**  I dont have to explain what this could mean in terms of revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Icing on the cake aka Pipeline:**

The company additionally has a nice pipeline of vaccines:

* The worlds first vaccine against RSV in Phase 3 with potential b$ revenues:
   * RSV-induced infections lead to approximately 177,525[\[1\]](https://bavariannordic1-my.sharepoint.com/personal/thomas_duschek_bavarian-nordic_com/Documents/Desktop/PR%202022-06-28%20MVA-BN%20RSV%20PRIME/PR%202022-06-28%20MVA-BN%20RSV%20PRIME%20Eligibility%20-%20EN%20final.docx#_edn1) hospitalizations and 14,0001 deaths in adults aged 65 years and older in the US, similar to influenza. Accordingly, preventing RSV-induced infections is a top priority for governments and medical professionals globally. Currently there is no approved vaccine against RSV.
* A COVID 19 vaccine based on virus-like particles instead of RNA with a phase 3 trial starting in 2022

I have been trading in and out of the stock from my first DD on, increasing positions on dips and selling the rips. Sold a good junk after it got its initial bounce. I do not think this whole Monkeypox-Thing is done yet. If cases start going down then I might change my opinion.

Overall the stock has demonstrated some nice strength over the past weeks. When WHO declined to announce the PHEIC I thought it would dip hard but it did not happen. I assume there is some accumulation going on at the moment.

# UBS to Pay $25 Million to Settle SEC Fraud Charges Involving Complex Options Trading Strategy

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
**2022-117**

*Washington D.C., June 29, 2022 ‚Äî*

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that UBS Financial Services Inc. has agreed to pay approximately $25 million to settle fraud charges relating to a complex investment strategy referred to as YES, or Yield Enhancement Strategy.

According to the SEC‚Äôs order, UBS marketed and sold YES to approximately 600 investors through its platform of domestic financial advisors from February 2016 through February 2017. The order finds that, during this time, UBS did not provide its financial advisors with adequate training and oversight in the strategy, and although UBS recognized and documented the possibility of significant risk in YES investments, it failed to share this data with advisors or clients. As a result, the order finds, some of UBS‚Äôs advisors did not understand the risks and were unable to form a reasonable belief that the advice they provided was in the best interest of their clients. When investors suffered losses, many of them, along with their financial advisors, expressed surprise and closed their YES accounts.

‚ÄúAdvisory firms are obligated to implement appropriate policies and procedures to ensure all parties involved in the sale of complex financial products and strategies have a clear understanding of the risks those products present,‚Äù said Osman Nawaz, Chief of the Division of Enforcement‚Äôs Complex Financial Instruments Unit. ‚ÄúAs fiduciaries, advisers also must make suitable recommendations to their clients. Complex products can present unique risks, and the SEC will remain vigilant and continue to take action to protect those who invest in these products from misconduct.‚Äù

UBS consented to the entry of the SEC‚Äôs order finding that it violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7. Without admitting or denying the SEC‚Äôs findings, UBS agreed to a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement of $5.8 million and prejudgment interest of $1.4 million, which is deemed satisfied by payments made to investors in related arbitration proceedings. UBS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $17.4 million, which it will undertake to distribute to harmed investors pursuant to the fair fund provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The SEC‚Äôs investigation was conducted by James F. Murtha, Jonathan C. Shapiro and Brent S. Mitchell, and was supervised by Reid A. Muoio of the Complex Instruments Unit with assistance from Timothy K. Halloran of the Trial Unit."

wallstreetbet,"Europe Natural Gas PlayI‚Äôve been reading a lot of griping on here about the lack of DD and posts other than memes. I love the memes, but I kinda agree. It‚Äôs time to start posting some plays again. So, here‚Äôs some DD for you retards. Keep in mind I‚Äôm an idiot and have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Here goes‚Ä¶

Europe is awesome and fucked in many ways. But they are mega-fucked in terms of energy. Natural Gas futures are showing 145 Euros / MWh right now (TTF August 2022). That is obscene. And it‚Äôs summer. With all the shit going on geopolitically, it‚Äôs going to go up a lot come fall/winter. 

The play is Trillion Energy (TCF, TRLEF, Z62-F). It‚Äôs a small Canadian NG explorer/producer that‚Äôs about to spud (drill) its first well in years. It has 2 primary assets, one in Turkey and one in Bulgaria, but the one that is getting drilled is in the Black Sea about 25 km north of the Turkish coast. BuT wHAt AbOut UKraiNe?! The Black Sea is huge and the NG fields are 500 km away from that shit so not a concern.  

Trillion just finished raising money for the drilling ‚Äì their coffers are full ($40 million in cash). The plan is to drill 17 wells in the next year (about 1 per month), with each well producing roughly 4000-7000 mcf/day. The first spud date is in one month and the rig is already reserved and leaves for Turkey end of July. Schlumberger is doing the drilling and they are the best.

Normally, Turkey (or T√ºrkiye now) pays a premium for its NG compared to the US and usually pays about $8-9/mcf. But because of the raging bull market in energy, Trillion gets paid $22/mcf. Their capex is low since they already own the 4 platforms, all the pipe infrastructure, and the on-shore facility tied to the main NG lines. Their opex is ridiculous at about $0.25/mcf. The current 2P reserves are 42 bcf with 3 known on-block exploration targets that could triple that reserve easily. 

At these prices the FCF by the end of 2022 is going to be $50 million/year. By mid-2023, it‚Äôll be well over $100 million/year. If prices go up more, which you know they will, the FCF could be closer to $200 million/year by next year.

The current market cap is $55 million. 

The Bulgarian asset is coal bed methane (CBM). It‚Äôs early stage, but it has a third party reserve report that says it has 500 bcf of NG waiting to be tapped. Bulgaria pays even more for their gas than Turkey. The plan is to use some of the profits to get this asset going.

The bad? Large float. Mucho paper coming free trading mid-July from a previous pp. CEO is a scientist not a promo guy and comes across as awkward in interviews. I personally like that, but I don‚Äôt think the market does. Always risk in oil and gas spudding. Something could go wrong during drilling. War? I doubt it but it‚Äôs a possibility. 

**TLDR ‚Äì stupid cheap natural gas play that‚Äôs about to get some super King Kamehameha FCF because of the energy crisis in Europe.**

**Citadel was also fined by the SEC for using algorithms between 2007 and 2010**:

*Citadel Securities, the market-making arm of billionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin, has agreed to pay $22.6 million to settle charges that it misled customers about the way it priced trades, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday.*

*The SEC found that between 2007 and 2010, Citadel used two algorithms to execute stock trades on customers‚Äô behalf that gave investors a worse price for their trades, even when Citadel knew better prices existed elsewhere. The SEC penalized Citadel for failing to disclose the use of those algorithms to clients.*

*‚ÄúThis affected millions of retail orders,‚Äù said Stephanie Avakian, the acting director of enforcement at the SEC.*

*Citadel neither admitted nor denied the findings.*

**Now lets break down PFOF and the brokers and venues paying for it.....**.

wallstreetbet,"Supreme Court restricts the EPA's authority to mandate carbon emissions reductionsThe U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a major blow to the Environmental Protection Agency's power to regulate carbon emissions that cause climate change. The decision by the conservative court majority sets the stage for further limitations on the regulatory power of other agencies as well.

By a vote of 6 to 3, the court said that any time an agency does something big and new ‚Äì in this case addressing climate change ‚Äì the regulation is presumptively invalid, unless Congress has specifically authorized regulating in this sphere.

At issue in the case were rules adopted by the Trump and Obama administrations and aimed at addressing the country's single-largest carbon emissions problem ‚Äì from coal-fired power plants. The Obama plan was broad, the Trump plan narrow. The Obama plan didn't regulate only coal-fired plants. Instead, it set strict carbon limits for each state and encouraged the states to meet those limits by relying less on coal-fired power plants and more on alternative sources of energy ‚Äì wind, solar, hydro-electric and natural gas. The goal of the plan was to produce enough electricity to satisfy U.S. demand in a way that lowered greenhouse emissions.

The concept worked so well that even after Obama's Clean Power Plan was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court and then repealed by the Trump administration, most utilities continued to abandon coal because it was just too expensive, compared to other energy producing methods. In fact, even without the regulation in place, the reduction targets for carbon emissions were met 11 years ahead of schedule.

Fearing the Obama approach might someday be revived, the coal industry, joined by West Virginia and 16 other states, went to court in support of the Trump plan and its more restrictive interpretation of the Clean Air Act. A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled against them in 2021.

But on Thursday, the Supreme Court sided with the coal industry, ruling that the Clean Air Act does not authorize anything other than direct regulation of coal-fired plants.

Writing for the court majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that under what the court has recently called the ""major questions doctrine,"" neither the EPA nor any other agency may adopt rules that are ""transformational"" to the economy ‚Äî unless Congress has specifically authorized such a transformative rule to address a specific problem, like climate change.

In his opinion, Roberts wrote: In ""certain extraordinary cases, both separation of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative intent make us 'reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text' the delegation claimed to be lurking there. Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324. To convince us otherwise, something more than a merely plausible textual basis for the agency action is necessary. The agency instead must point to 'clear congressional authorization' for the power it claims.""

Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent: ""Today, the court strips the EPA of the power Congress gave it to respond to the most pressing environmental challenge of our time. ... It deprives EPA of the power needed‚Äîand the power granted‚Äîto curb the emission of greenhouse gasses.""

She was joined by the court's other two liberals.

The decision appears to enact major new limits on agency regulations across the economy, limits of a kind not imposed by the court for 75 years or more. The decision, for instance, casts a cloud of doubt over a proposed Securities and Exchange Commission rule that would require companies offering securities to the public to disclose climate-related risks ‚Äì like severe weather events that have or likely will affect their business models. Also in jeopardy is a new interim rule adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ""aimed at treating greenhouse gas emissions and their contribution to climate change the same as all other environmental impacts [the Commission] considers.""

The decision was a particularly bad omen for environmentalists. In a very real sense, it seemed to reject any holistic regulatory attempt to deal with climate change.

What's more, the way the court dealt with the case is an indication of its new and very muscular approach to regulations in general. After all, when the case was initially before the court, for all practical purposes, there was no regulation in place. The Obama rule had been put on hold by the court and then repealed by the Trump administration; the Trump rule had similarly been paused, and the Biden administration said it would not adopt either the Obama or Trump approach. So it would have been easy, indeed, even expected, that the Supreme Court would toss the whole case out and wait for a new rule to be adopted.

As Case Western Reserve professor Jonathan Adler put it, ""The fact that the court took the case shows that these are justices in a hurry"" ‚Äì in a hurry to rewrite the nation's regulatory laws in a way not seen in three quarters of a century.

Harvard law professor Richard Lazarus had an even more ominous view. ""By insisting that Congress must specifically authorize significant rules at a time when the justices know that Congress is effectively dysfunctional, the court threatens to upend the national government's ability to safeguard the public health and welfare."" The court, he added, is taking these ""dire"" steps ""at the very moment when the United States, and all nations, are facing our greatest environmental challenge of all: climate change.""

wallstreetbet,"Biden says Americans will have to stomach high gas prices ‚Äú'as long as it takes'‚Äù to beat back Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine&gt;US President Joe Biden said Americans will have to stomach high gas prices ‚Äúas long as it takes‚Äù to beat back Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAs long as it takes, so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine,‚Äù Biden told reporters Thursday in Madrid, in response to a question about how long high gas prices might persist. His comments echoes those of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his closest geopolitical ally and one who is facing similar pressures back home about the cost-of-living crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;The national average gasoline price hit a record this month above $5 a gallon, even after Biden ordered a historic release from US reserves earlier this year. Prices at the pump have been a main driver of inflation, which has been a major [political headache](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/biden-team-points-at-the-fed-as-inflation-news-keeps-worsening) for the Biden administration.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden said he‚Äôll ask allies in the Persian Gulf region to boost oil production when he meets with them during a trip to Saudi Arabia next month, though he pointedly refrained to say he‚Äôd ask the country‚Äôs de-facto leader to directly when he meets de-facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, in person next month.  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden‚Äôs latest comments about inflation -- which amount to telling voters that they need to brace themselves for the long haul -- are unlikely to play well.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Americans have cited inflation -- which hit a four-decade high this spring -- as their primary concern heading into November midterms. Democrats will likely lose control of Congress. That worst-case scenario will become even likelier if the US. goes into recession. Concerns about such a downturn are growing daily.  
&gt;  
&gt;An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research¬†[ poll ](https://apnews.com/article/inflation-russia-ukraine-biden-covid-health-b6d1751b2554555f7246f9e914b87c59)released Wednesday found that 85% of adults said the country was on the wrong track, with 79% describing the economy as ‚Äúpoor.‚Äù¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;In that same poll, 67% of Democrats deemed economic conditions as bad.  
&gt;  
&gt;The White House has taken pains to show it is trying to solve the inflation quandary -- by tackling supply chain snarls, releasing extra barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and lifting the ban of E15 gas during the summer.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Biedn has called on Congress to suspend the federal gas tax for three months, but that proposal was met with resistance from key Democratic lawmakers.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden aides have tried to point to the strong labor market and low unemployment rate as the major bright spot of the economy -- and evidence of their strong stewardship of the U.S. during Covid.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far, that hasn‚Äôt worked.

U.S. probes Tesla crash that killed motorcyclist in Utah

WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Tuesday it has opened a special investigation into the crash of a 2020 Tesla Model 3 vehicle that killed a motorcyclist in Utah.

The driver of a Tesla in a crash Sunday that fatally injured a motorcycle rider told police the vehicle was using Autopilot, an advanced driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks.

Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used. A total of 19 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla-related investigations, including the most recent fatal Utah crash.

The Utah Department of Public Safety (DPS) said on Sunday, a Harley Davidson motorcycle was traveling in the high occupancy lane southbound on I-15 near Draper, Utah at 1:09 a.m. when a Tesla collided with the back of the motorcycle, which threw the rider from the bike. The 34-year-old motorcyclist rider suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene.

DPS said ""the driver advised he had the Autopilot setting on"" and did not see the motorcyclist.""

Last week, NHTSA said it opened a special investigation into the crash of a 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicle that killed a motorcyclist in California. Media reports said a 48-year-old motorcyclist was killed on July 7 after a collision with a 2021 Tesla Model Y on the Riverside Freeway in California.

NHTSA typically opens more than 100 special crash investigations annually into emerging technologies and other potential auto safety issues that have, for instance, previously helped to develop safety rules on air bags.

Tesla, which has disbanded its press office, did not respond to a request for comment.

In June, NHTSA upgraded its defect investigation into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, a required step before it could seek a recall.

wallstreetbet,"DD: META PUTS - Advertising Decline? Or TikTok Eating Market Share?The narrative around Q2 earnings for big tech has prominently focused around a weakened advertising market, and of course, a recession. But I believe the real elephant in the room is TikTok. Let's dive in.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f83ow09d4zd91.png?width=1648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49dac40e1a7f814e5f47988fc9eaa369ca581022

Once we learned this, the fear was advertising reduction will be felt across the board with big tech, e.g. GOOGL, AMZN, META, etc. And then came the GOOGL print today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fh5sfjrr4zd91.png?width=2496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a388e2121d4d29e4f9c1686cf910c2d30116749

So now i'm reading that GOOGL's miss was better than expected? I mean, they missed. But they're directly looking at ad spend which still grew.... but pretty flat on a YoY basis.   


Let's shift our attention back to SNAP to their DAU's (Daily Active Users). 

https://preview.redd.it/igous7lu5zd91.png?width=3196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2f0983105ab46dc1b5ba603d63ca194ed917b0d

Growth is SLOW SLOW SLOW. 

Someone is eating their lunch and dinner and we all know who that is....TikTok

We all know the DAU for TikTok is increasing, taking marketshare from FB, IG, SNAP, etc. WITH a slowing advertising spend.   


TLDR: Reduction of ad spend is not the main concern for META, it's the combo of TikTok eating market share AND a slowing ad spend market that will send META much lower. SNAP earnings are more comparable to META vs GOOGL's ad spend for Q2.

Which gives you access to the Data and tools previously us 99% of the retail market couldn‚Äôt get a hold of. This platform honestly rivals some of the Features the $24,000 a year Bloomberg terminal has to offer, and.. for free!

Download link: [https://www.openbb.co/products/terminal#get-started](https://www.openbb.co/products/terminal#get-started)

I‚Äôll run through some of the features and how to use them briefly as it requires a little bit of Python knowledge to use it (although it took me just a day of using it to get to a comfortable level ‚Äì having had no prior coding knowledge). For the smooth brains out there, follow the pictures and text and YOU too should have access to some of the data Wall Street has access to.

&amp;#x200B;

So after installing and opening the terminal you will be shown the available options within the platform. (which as is tradition the Bullshit ones we‚Äôll ignore) 

&amp;#x200B;

All that needs to be typed is: Stocks (But the right hand column ‚Äì gives a little rundown of the features available on each of the functions, which once you go to that menu will give more info).

We‚Äôll start with options (OBVIOUSLY!!) just for an example TSLA and I won't go into too much information as I‚Äôll leave that to you to have a nosey round, and get familiar. So to do so simply into the command line type stocks, once it‚Äôs loaded the next box, type load and the ticker name e,.g. \[load tsla\] again once the next box has popped up type options which should look like the picture below once finished. So,

1. stocks
2. load tsla
3. options

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the titles are self-explanatory so I‚Äôll just put in pretty pictures instead.

In the available expiration dates picture you can see all of the selectable options dates. To bring this up type:

1. exp
2. exp 3 (the number being the corresponding date you‚Äôd like) which will then set it

Again I don‚Äôt want to overload with information here this is merely just to show off some of the features and the fact that this is giving; software, data and functions only available to the rich players on WallStreet back to Retail traders to level out the playing field a little. So go Free and have a look yourselves, at the power of this platform! Take my word for it, it‚Äôs mind-blowingly good.

So final topic: the Stock feature -  (I won't go into too many features this section has to offer and will mostly just cover the main pages as otherwise it will go on all day)

&amp;#x200B;

Another one of my favorites would be the Gov function (stocks/ gov/ load tsla) which allows you to see specific government activity based on all if (you didn‚Äôt load a ticker) or if you did on that ticker itself like shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also a feature in which you can run a tickers chart against Jim Cramer's stock recommendations regarding the buy/ sell signals he‚Äôs given.

To have a quick check and see if he‚Äôs cursed your stock pick before you go ahead and buy those calls/ puts. Also you can set the timeframe you‚Äôre wanting  (-s = start date, -e end date) such as:

1. stocks
2. load tsla -s 2019-01-01 -e 2022-08-01

The ability to export any visual information and tables to PNG, JPG e.t.c.

In closing I just want to say this program has absolutely amazing features so many i could never be able to cover in one post nor some of them i‚Äôd even understand. and with it being open source new collaborators and functions will be from what i can see added all the time. I'm obviously no expert on this product, having only just come across it. But if anyone has any questions I'll do my best to answer them below.

This is especially tru a country where the sitting president needs to keep there support high when planning to run for a second term.

The problem in the USA currently is that Bidone is too old to run again and the research show‚Äôs that the republicans will take the house back later this year. Leaving Bidone as a lame duck for the next 2 years.

So, I‚Äôm thinking that if things work out as described above. There will not be political pressure from the USA government for the FED to pivot. 
As the republicans will want a recession that huppend under a democrat present to strengthen their campaign. With slogans like ‚Äòthe democrats crashed the economy‚Äô.

So the house and the senate will be gridlock and the president will be useless. This will leave the Fed to keep hiking in an attempt to stop inflation with no compression that the inflation we are currently experiencing is being driven by political decisions"

wallstreetbet,"Bullish Argument for $INTCBefore I even start, take all this with a tiny grain of salt, I currently have \~600$ in my Robinhood, and \~500$ of it is in a long call for Intel expiring in 2024. Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter.

**Fundamentals**

As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was \~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of \~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of \~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology.

Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc.

(source: [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/pedata.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html))

**Current Policies**

Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan.

I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.

We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html))

While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain. (source: [https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel\_germany\_tsmc/#:\~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel_germany_tsmc/#:~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber).)

**Recent History**

In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&amp;D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months).

Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&amp;D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back.

Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/)). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers.

**Final Thoughts**

The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock.

Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:\~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30](https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30)) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance.

While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run.

Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such. Thank you!"

wallstreetbet,"is the Witcher / Cyberpunk 2077 worth $2B?Currently the market cap of CD projekt RED is sitting on $2B, i am wondering right now if the witcher franchise / cyberpunk 2077 franchise could be worth $2B.

Currently the P/E ratio of CDPR is high a 38, but this does not take into account their triple A releases that occur once in 5 years ( for 2025 they are planning to release 2 triple A titles, the witcher 4 and the next cyberpunk).
If you would divide the sales and capitalized R&amp;D of the cyberpunk 2077 release sales (0,9B PLN) over 5 years and add that back to the earnings, the p/e ratio is actually close to 20.

For the current market and compared to it's competition a p/e of 20 can still be considered high.
Not to mention the hit to their reputation they got with the awfull launch of cyberpunk 2077.

wallstreetbet,"High priced stock will plummet unless a stock split happens. $tsla  

You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but this is true when it comes to availability in mathematics.

**Stock splits are to protect companies from sell offs and to provide a false sense of security.**

This is my logic for the above claim:

1.) Forget penny stocks for now. Stocks *in general* trade up to 2 decimal points, to the hundredths of a full number. 

2.) A stock trading at $100 before going to $0 has 10,000 leading prices that buyers and sellers can trade at before the stock is worth $0.

3.) A stock trading at $1000 has 100,000 leading prices that buyers and sellers can trade at before a stock is worth $0.

4.) A company‚Äôs current stock price is based off the last traded price.

*Assuming the company is not going bankrupt to $0 but the market is not doing well because of uncertainty, doubt, and fomo. You have the below.*

5.) At $1000, with 100,000 prices to sell at, people can get more competitive in selling.

6.) At $100, with 10,000 prices to trade at, there is less price action available.

How do you benefit from this in any way? 

High priced stock that has good volume and liquidity will sell down in bad times. With a stock split and a lower pricing, there is less volatility. Here‚Äôs a screener of high-priced stocks with average volume.

wallstreetbet,"Jim Cramer‚Äôs week ahead: Fed's actions could lead to market rally with big earnings on deckCNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday told investors that the Federal Reserve's actions this week could lead to a bull market.

""If [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell says, 'we're getting a 75 basis point rate hike and then we'll see what happens' ‚Ä¶ then you might get a rip-snorting rally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.


""On the other hand, if he says we're doing the triple-rate hike and then we're willing to keep tightening no matter what, including a possible inter-meeting hike if the CPI stays hot, then we are definitely going lower,"" he added, referring to June's hotter-than expected 9.1% inflation reading.

The Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and many analysts expect a 75 basis point rate hike. 

Cramer also previewed this week's slate of earnings. All earnings and revenue estimates are courtesy of FactSet.

Tuesday: General Electric, Alphabet, Microsoft


General Electric 

Q2 2022 earnings release at 6:30 a.m. ET; conference call at 8 a.m. ET

Projected EPS: 37 cents

Projected revenue: $17.36 billion

Cramer said he's not bullish on GE ‚Äì yet.

Alphabet 

Q2 2022 earnings release at 4 p.m. ET; conference call at 5 p.m. ET

Projected EPS: $1.27

Projected revenue: $69.87 billion

Microsoft 

Q4 2022 earnings release at 4:05 p.m. ET; conference call at 5:30 p.m. ET

Projected EPS: $2.29

Projected revenue: $52.39 billion


Cramer said he believes both Alphabet and Microsoft could have standout quarters.

Wednesday: Boeing, Meta, Ford, ServiceNow

Boeing 

Q2 2022 earnings release at 7:30 a.m. ET; conference call at 10:30 a.m. ET

Projected loss: loss of 13 cents per share

Projected revenue: $17.57 billion

He said he's doubtful that Boeing will report a solid quarter given the ongoing worker strikes and no federal go-ahead for its 787 Dreamliner commercial jets.

Meta

Q2 2022 earnings release at 4:05 p.m. ET; conference call at 5 p.m. ET
Projected EPS: $2.55
Projected revenue: $28.92 billion
Meta will likely report an earnings beat and forecast cut, Cramer predicted. ""Once the expectations get low enough, though, for the metaverse, then the stock becomes a solid buy,"" he said.

Ford

Q2 2022 earnings release at 4:05 p.m. ET; conference call at 5 p.m. ET
Projected EPS: 45 cents
Projected revenue: $37.20 billion
Cramer believes the carmaker will report that it's sold out of many models.

ServiceNow

Q2 2022 earnings release at 4:10 p.m. ET; conference call at 5 p.m. ET
Projected EPS: $1.55
Projected revenue: $1.76 billion
""We had CEO Bill McDermott on last month, and he talked about tougher times in Europe. His stock got hit hard in response ‚Äî now we'll find out if that was an overreaction,"" he said.

Thursday: Apple, Amazon

Apple

Q3 2022 earnings release at 4:30 p.m. ET; conference call at 5 p.m. ET
Projected EPS: $1.16
Projected revenue: $82.73 billion
""Own it, don't trade it,"" Cramer said.

Amazon

Q2 2022 earnings release at 4 p.m. ET; conference call at 5:30 p.m. ET
Projected EPS: 12 cents
Projected revenue: $118.98 billion
Cramer said Amazon's stock price could open ""very low"" at Tuesday's market open after Walmart cut its profit outlook Monday, dragging the e-commerce giant's stock down after-hours.

Friday: Chevron, Procter &amp; Gamble

Chevron

Q2 2022 earnings release at tbd time; conference call at 11 a.m. ET
Projected EPS: $5.08 
Projected revenue; $58.66 billion
Cramer said he believes Chevron will deliver great results in its latest quarter, even if analysts are growing increasingly skeptical of the company's ability to perform.

Procter &amp; Gamble

Q4 2022 earnings release at 6:55 a.m. ET; conference call at 9 a.m. ET
Projected EPS: $1.22
Projected revenue: $19.41 billion
""If Procter comes in, I'd treat that as a buying opportunity ‚Äî after it reports though,"" Cramer said.

wallstreetbet,"Yardeni Says S&amp;P 500 Has Already Bottomed, Sees No Hard LandingAhead of the Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech earnings later this week, Ed Yardeni has some words of comfort: the worst has passed for this bear market.

In the view of the Yardeni Research president, the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs plunge last month to a 3,666.77 low likely marked the trough of the 2022 equity rout. Underpinning the sanguine call is the resilience in corporate earnings and the still-healthy outlook for consumers and businesses even as the economy slows.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to pick a bottom in the stock market, but I‚Äôm going to give it a try,‚Äù Yardeni said on Bloomberg TV. ‚ÄúThe real question is going to be the earnings season, and so far the earnings season is going reasonably well. It has not really thrashed the stock market, and the stock market‚Äôs held up quite well.‚Äù

The statement is a large one ahead of a decisive week -- the Fed looks all set for another supersized interest-rate hike on Wednesday, while most mega-cap technology companies, including Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon, Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, will release their earnings reports.

Yardeni appears to be in the minority. In Bank of America Corp.‚Äôs survey this month, money managers said they‚Äôve cut their equity exposure to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of no faith in recent market bounce. At the end of June, a Deutsche Bank AG poll showed 72% of respondents expected the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 3,300 first, rather than rallying to 4,500.

But if Yardeni‚Äôs track record is any indication, it‚Äôs worth heeding the view of a market veteran who coined terms like ‚ÄúFed Model‚Äù and ‚Äúbond vigilante.‚Äù The strategist, who worked at Oak Associates Ltd. and Deutsche Bank before founding his namesake research firm, called the equity bottom the same month when the 1982 bear market ended. He then repeated the success in March 2009 when the S&amp;P 500 reached an intraday low of 666.79 -- 3,000 points below this year‚Äôs trough in what he calls another ‚Äúdevilish number.‚Äù

Read the full article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yardeni-says-p-500-already-183130142.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yardeni-says-p-500-already-183130142.html)

Make whatever you of it. I wont argue with that. Also today before bell Mac Donald's and Coke beat due to pricing power. Guys i know its hard to get even healthy food. Hence we keep going to these places for cheap food but these economists man. They still give the argument consumers strong because credit card spending as reported by banks. What a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

The main purpose of writing this article was well about this simple logic. IMF just released their growth forecasts. India and Saudi Arabia are leading. So what does this mean if you guys are wondering. Well it means. India is gonna grow relatively well as compared to other countries even in Global Recession. I don't trust Saudi due to World cup 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

So how to trade it. Well you have to wait for Dxy to go down. That's how investors shift portfolio. Dxy down generally means emerging markets up. Also you make in for Usd-Inr to go down.

&amp;#x200B;

As for us United States well they lowered it to 2.3%. I wouldn't be surprised if we grow -ve by year end. Just kidding.

wallstreetbet,"President Biden says ‚Äòwe‚Äôre not going to be in a recession, in my view‚Äô. Do you agree? President Joe Biden and White House officials are continuing to downplay recession fears, even as they brace for a highly anticipated report that could show the economy shrinking for a second consecutive quarter.

""We're not going to be in a recession, in my view,"" Biden told reporters on Monday. ""The employment rate is still one of the lowest we've had in history. It's in the 3.6 (percent) area. We still find ourselves, the people, investing.""

""My hope is we go from this rapid growth to a steady growth. And so, we'll see some coming down. But I don't think we're going to -- God willing -- I don't think we're going to see a recession,"" he continued.

While there is no steadfast rule governing what defines a recession in the United States, it is commonly understood to be two consecutive quarters of the country's gross domestic product -- or GDP -- shrinking. But a small group of economists on the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially define when the US economy is in a recession, and they define a recession as involving ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.""

The US is expecting a number of key economic reports this week aside from the second quarter GDP numbers coming Thursday, including Tuesday's consumer confidence survey and Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditure index. The Federal Reserve also meets on Wednesday to discuss interest rates.

Top Biden administration officials continue to insist the economy is not in recession amid widespread inflation.

wallstreetbet,"PSNY - Interesting Ownership + SI ComboRan across a compelling write-up on Twitter. With consent of the author, repeating chunks of it here. Enjoy.

For starters, 94.7% of the float is controlled by Li Shufu. Nearly the entire float is tied up and I‚Äôm assuming there is no incentive to sell as he is probably raking it in with the 300% CTB that shorts are paying. This is one unique additive to the situation. 

https://preview.redd.it/40yjc6so64j91.png?width=897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17dcfb51f2aced5565d964f589f41c18b632c835

Ortex data is as follows. There is 9.23M shares short with a float that is 94.7% controlled by one person leaving the free float rather small. Shorts are paying out the ass with a 307% CTB and the stock never dropped like many thought it would and you can assume 

https://preview.redd.it/3lhr43eq64j91.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d740f010f2bf29ef1ef67c7db0f2eb3feae43f2f

Shorts may be underwater once the stock trades over 10 which should create pressure. Thirdly, there is no shares available to short on a stock with high short interest given free float is rather small and float is very tight given the ownership and share structure. 

https://preview.redd.it/f7f6mtut64j91.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c30029d76e93f2025e23d7d66bcbc5bcadaa3cf0

 In terms of free float, Volvo seems to be the majority holder. 

https://preview.redd.it/05ymy4hx64j91.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b73f2d3fab0387ad465285153d704b15794a430b

Lastly, the option chain is Jacked for all mopex dates, specifically October and January. Moves above certain strikes as we have seen before create pressure and heat on shorts. The IV is a whooping mid 50% on October and January contracts. These seem severely mispriced.

The stock has largely been beaten down do to poor management and their ceo being paid a fortune even if the company isn‚Äôt doing so good. All that said subscription numbers have kept going up and the stock has recently double triple showing some resistance at the 13.10$ mark. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their price to book ratio (PB) is 0.61 and their earnings per share are forecasted to grow. The downsides are that the company is largely in debt and its on the process of merging its streaming platforms (HBO MAX, DISCOVERY) if the merger succeeds WBD will definitely be a streaming powerhouse but if they fuck up this might kill the stock entirely. Insiders have been buying shares which is always good and they are fairly undervalued using some fundamental ratios.

So, I got greedy. I got back into BBBY on Friday. Sold a bunch of covered calls - stocks avg at 11, sold about 2k of options with 11 strike expiring on Friday and closed out same day for full profit.

Then the mistake - maybe. I sold another shit load of calls at 11 strike exp 8/26. My stock avg is now 10.3. 

Then it dropped after hours and now I don‚Äôt know. 

option 1: Hold in case it pumps again. I really really don‚Äôt want to be short shares in case of a squeeze but at the same time, this is company is a POS and could collapse to 5

Option 2:  sell the shares (I have the margin to be short those calls without underlying stock) but monitor the situation in case it looks like it might blow up again and then buy back in. I‚Äôll realize a loss on the shares but whatever, can‚Äôt win em all.

2. RC will somehow be involved with another aspect of BBBY (ie Baby, something we aren‚Äôt aware of, etc) and cannot own those shares 

In option 1, as others have shown with their fabulous DD, RC would likely be investigated for insider trading. Somebody worth so much money is probably not going to risk that for chump change (relative to his net worth).

wallstreetbet,"Tesla Humanoid Robot was (biggest FCF)tesla humanoid robot would be huge, it will displace the entire porn industry, imagine 100,000 humanoid robot hookers in the world, each getting pay $100-200 for ""services"", multiply by 20, (roughly 1 hr per service, so 20 hrs a day, plus 4 hour of charging and maintenance) so each robot can possibly earn $3000 a day, and that is over $1M a year. That's 100 billion FCF every year.

All in on $TSLA bois. just the robot hooker can generate $100 BILLION. Then you have the janitors, fast food workers, delivery guys, etc. that's at least a 1 trillon dollar cash flow, making tesla worth at least 20 trillion market cap."

wallstreetbet,"Friend or not?Hey all,

I've seen some crazy posts where people are recommending meme stocks here and there. I just want to share a (friendly) little piece of advice that I've learned about over the years. 

Start by understanding that nobody here at wallstreetbets is your friend. Yahoo Finance is not your friend, Jim Cramer is not your friend, CNBC, CNN etc. is not your friend. There are no friends in this business, you are alone and you are alone responsible for the decisions you make. See all news, forums, discords etc. as entertainment at best. They know absolutely shit about what the future will bring. 

Always ask yourself: Why is this person saying this and recommending that? To teach you the magic formula to infinite wealth? Absolutely not. Always assume that everybody got their own agenda. The person drawing stupid TA lines with random support/resistance levels telling you that right now is the time to buy stock xxx because of x y z yadaa yada. Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity etc. Maybe this person just wants to get out of his own position and wants you to buy his stinking stocks.

Do your own research. Example: Why is BBBY one of the most shorted stock on the market. If you don't understand about short and long positions and the risks involved this is not a stock for you. You will lose, almost guaranteed. Why are so many betting on it to crash down? Simple answer: BBBY is doing terrible. They are bleeding money. It's sudden explosive movements upwards is not because BBBY is a good and healthy company and everybody wants to buy the stock. Learn about the mechanics behind these explosive up and down movements."
wallstreetbet,"Ryan Cohen actually warned us Apes ü¶ç in advance to help us from the inevitable decline and possible bankruptcy of BBBYhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ryan-cohen-bed-bath-beyond-august-17-202557136.html

On Wednesday August 17th‚Ä¶ news broke that Ryan Cohen filed SEC filings to unload shares/options in BBBY.  This was the opportunity for us ü¶ç apes to get out of the way as worse was yet to come.   

Say what you want, but people sell out for a reason.  I don‚Äôt know or any investor who sells out of a company because good news is coming.  This was his way of warning us worse is coming.

The following day the truth is revealed and he sold out completely ‚Ä¶ but why ?   No one knows for sure.  Likely he couldn‚Äôt work out a turn around plan with management of BBBY, I think he tried and couldn‚Äôt make it work.  Now the company is at best facing likely share dilution, total restructuring and possible bankruptcy‚Ä¶ all of them will hurt share investors if not wipe them out completely.

It is my personal and reasonable opinion; five (5) Justices shall use Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency to invalidate/prohibit the Army Corps of Engineers‚Äô/the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs definition of Waters of the United States and four (4) Justices (maybe less) will fail to restore accountability to the American-citizen-voters and secure complete congressional compliance with Article One, Section 1 of the United States Constitution.

The Constitution of the United States; Article I, Section 1 states, ‚ÄúAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives‚Äù. 1

The doctrine of nondelegation (or non-delegation principle) is the theory that one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is explicit or implicit in all written constitutions that impose a strict structural separation of powers. 2

Tension in administrative law is rising due to some interest in the resurgence of the nondelegation doctrine among scholars and in the Supreme Court (most notably, in writings of Justices Thomas and Gorsuch). 3

A simple definition of \[\] the major rules doctrine \[is\] ‚Ä¶ major rules implicating issues of deep economic and political significance are presumptively unlawful, absent a statutory clear statement providing otherwise. 4

\[\] The major rules doctrine, as put forward by Judge Kavanaugh \[Justice Kavanaugh\], would deny even de novo \[Latin for anew\] review, declaring a rule of major economic and political significance unlawful unless Congress provided a clear statement authorizing the agency to do so. 3

Justice Gorsuch, among others, argues that the current administrative state \[\] violates the separation of powers as the Framers intended. Under his \[Justice Gorsuch‚Äôs\] view, the Constitution vests the legislature with the power to make the law, but \[\] Congress is unconstitutionally delegating too much of that power to the executive in the form of regulatory agencies. 5

\[In the June 30, 2022,  decision [*West Virginia v Environmental Protection Agency*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf);\] Justice Neil Gorsuch, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito, also gave the major questions doctrine heft by claiming it shielded against ‚Äúunintentional, oblique, or otherwise unlikely intrusions‚Äù upon such questions as ‚Äúself-government, equality, fair notice, federalism, and the separation of powers.‚Äù 6

As a justice, \[Amy Coney\] Barrett has behaved as an unapologetic pragmatist. Along with the Court‚Äôs [other Republican appointees](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/26/20981758/brett-kavanaughs-terrify-democrats-supreme-court-gundy-paul), Barrett [supports flexible](https://www.vox.com/22883639/supreme-court-vaccines-osha-cms-biden-mandate-nfib-labor-missouri) [legal doctrines](https://www.vox.com/2020/7/8/21317323/supreme-court-obamacare-little-sisters-clarence-thomas-pennsylvania-birth-control) that give her Court maximal discretion to veto federal regulations that a majority of the justices disagree with ‚Äî especially regulations promoting [public health](https://www.vox.com/22883639/supreme-court-vaccines-osha-cms-biden-mandate-nfib-labor-missouri) or [protecting the environment](https://www.vox.com/2021/11/3/22758188/climate-change-epa-clean-power-plan-supreme-court). 7

**Disclaimer :**

Apologies beforehand for a lot of verbose because of the final newsletter. For quick read up i suggest reading ""Tl;dr section"" ( headings ) and for the reasons behind it are included in the detailed ""Experiment section"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro:**

&amp;#x200B;

    ‚ÄúI felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices slowly and wildly got together and then there was an uprising against the government and the financial institutions‚Äù
    

Sorry guys, I was supposed to send this the day before yesterday ( great movie ) but unfortunately I got caught up in a celebration we are having over here.

So it's the start of the weekend. Y‚Äôall know what that means. I'm not talking about having a party lol, that is for me. You guys have to decipher this long post so that you can protect yourself from the upcoming danger that I am seeing. In short you‚Äôre fucked if you don‚Äôt read this especially institutions and hedge funds. Just for this week please avoid strip clubs. This one's for you guys because you read my post. ( I like to think so )

Retail public especially retards i don‚Äôt have words for you guys. You guys can chill this weekend because all you do is sh9t on my post. Might as well sh9t on this too. I don‚Äôt care since all you‚Äôre obsessed with is Ryan Cohen and $BBBY. So when you‚Äôre finally over him after getting drunk this weekend then you can go ahead and read this post. Could be worth your time.

&amp;#x200B;

As for people asking me why I don't give my opinions regarding meme stocks. Well folks the reason is simple. We are still in a bear market according to my calculations. So it's written somewhere in the gospel of investing that bear markets are the opportunities to analyze value companies, not meme companies which are about to be purge in the upcoming mega crash as an offering to please the gods of stock market.

Yes you ‚ÄúYou-tube‚Äù folks the crash hasn‚Äôt even started yet. We still have -53% to go from here till March 2023 as my base case. Don't even ask me about my worst case. For that just open the Dow Jones 1929-1932 chart.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr and Td;du folks : ( Too long didn't read, Too dumb didn‚Äôt understand )**

We have already discussed this : Buy 4 months/2 months/1 months puts i.e Dec 30/Oct 29/Sept 29 at the money with strike price near about ""200 day moving average = 200dMA"" in $SPY last week of august if it comes. 

It already did one time on August 16 and i think the top is already in. So you‚Äôre gonna profit regardless.

Invalidation would be three white soldier candles above 200dMA of course in daily chart. For positions go scroll down. ( I will make you work for it at-least. xD )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[We have a long way to go friends.](https://preview.redd.it/vacale5b52j91.png?width=1643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b3152d06dfbe35d8a9ca145d06fb6271cfe08b)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now for those folks who want a detailed explanation about everything let‚Äôs dive in.

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

&amp;#x200B;

How are you guys doing? It‚Äôs been a long time hasn‚Äôt it. God I was gone for a while and had Ni-san use my Reddit account for a few days. First of all, I'm gonna apologize for the Shzio post by my brother Itachi. Man, it felt like it messed up my brains for a while there. It was so damn trippy.  So I highly highly advise you guys not to go and read it a second time. Please, it's for your own health. 

Regardless i love my brother analysis coz he thinks like no other normal people do in the world of trading/investing. So, I take full responsibility for my actions and if things don't go as planned out in the above charts ( i.e the mega crash doesn‚Äôt happen you know ) then you‚Äôre not gonna hear from us.

P.s. We promised you that we will do these posts only in bear markets. Even if the USA goes into depression for 10 to 15 years we will post in a week or two until we visit ath ( all time high ) once again. One may ask why not do this stuff in the bull market? Guys you have to understand we are not bull market specialists. For bull markets it's generally advised to follow moon boys on twitter, tik-tok, You-tube etc. They are more educated and well informed than us in that department with a huge audience behind them. ( They spend so much on marketing lol )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Recap : Predictions 2022 so far.**

I don‚Äôt usually like to do this because my readers already know about this but it‚Äôs time to back-test how accurate we ( i.e. me and my brother ) have been this whole time especially to show random people who are new to reading these kinds of posts especially when it‚Äôs season finale.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* We predicted the March 16 post Fomc rally.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n7xv1xs52j91.png?width=1851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef518b9218d0bc29d830fc61927009ece8a66438

* We predicted the April top. Thought it was gonna last two to three days more but it lasted just one.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ictvxtex52j91.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1905d15b9028016b853e12dd817097c285d2eac7

* Then we predicted June Fomc bottom which we already mentioned in our first letter. Does ‚ÄúDante cash deployment $SPX $3600-3700 at trend based 1 fib‚Äù ring a bell. ( But then later i said to just sell above 2% because Cpi 8.8% est and Atlanta Fed Gdp -2.1% est scared the sh9t out of me and i changed my strategy from ""Riding to the top of the Bear market rally"" to ""Shorting at the top of bear market rally"" )

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/brojy4p462j91.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a96db2532fe7643a3b03e3f2293102e8c28a06e2

* And now we finally did the same for August top at 15/16 i.e. 200dMA/ 50-61.8% fib retrace which is just a follow up to above June Fomc bottom. post.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/da60ccei62j91.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9e342a4a1f31b7ed9cd4931c8511bdd9368ae5

&amp;#x200B;

And then there were bond, commodity, Dxy calls that we are not even mentioning.

What this all means is that the stock markets have been performing as we had hoped for since February which is like 6-7 months ago. So i guess we are not a broken clock and actually do provide the exact days or should i say the time horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Am I a member of secret society i.e. ""Illuminati‚Äù or have contacts in ""Pay pal mafia"" ?**

No guys. I am not a member of secret society nor do i have any contacts. My brother do though. I do want to manage the portfolio of wealthy clients like my brother someday but I'm too lazy. I just want to take bets and watch anime and Tv shows my entire life. I just finished West world and now i guess i will watch episode 1 of ‚ÄúHouse of dragons‚Äù. ( Why did that producer said bad things about Emilia. Hmm ) As for anime recommendation man its getting hard to find good ones. I'm just waiting for Chainsaw man now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my self.**

Before all of this I was a Computer Science student whose only good skill was learning a hybrid application development platform called Flutter ( By Google ) but now I just write detailed and boring posts on Wall Street bets about anything that comes to my mind for you guys. My predictions come right because of you folks so thank you for taking trades and also I just basically copy pasted 2008 charts ( 32nd death week ) like I do with Git-hub while programming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Now will I be wrong in the future?**

Of course I will be. I‚Äôm no economist. I just make cases i.e stock market = 1972-73 or 2008 and just bet on them. Also a big hedge fund guy might find my post someday and take the opposite trade against me wrecking people who followed my advice.

Hence i always tell you guys ‚ÄúDo your own research‚Äú ‚ÄúThis is not financial advice‚Äù even though it will be right most of the time. You absolutely should not follow anybody w/o checking out at-least 10 other guys.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why take my advice ?**

So now that we have cleared some of the confusion which I couldn't in my Wsb guest talk appearance you might be thinking why we should even consider your advice in the top 10 folks we watch. You‚Äôre a nobody. Well folks in my defense i would say it's because I gradually improved myself. Earlier my posts were shitty but now they are getting better especially my T.A. And I'm also learning economics day by day. Do you know guys I didn't wanted to write this as final post coz I was actually busy working on other post like ‚ÄúDeciphering Stagflation 70's‚Äù and ‚ÄúThermodynamics in Economics‚Äù as my farewell post. Yes it's true guys the US economy is one giant open system. That‚Äôs how Elon Musk and Jerome Powell do calculations about economics. xD

Well enough spoilers about the next season. I know you guys are getting bored. So lets now finally jump in what i wanted to actually talk about. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Experiment :**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Deriving conclusions about Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 and rest other asset classes using other asset classes on weekly and monthly charts. I know it sounds insane right now but you will see. So just trust me on this. (My grammar is so poor)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Tools :**‚Äù

I mean the Technicals i will be using today includes :

\-&gt; Candle sticks

\-&gt; Elliot wave with Fibonacci

\-&gt; Stochastic Rsi

\-&gt; My favorite which never ever lies : Pvt(O)

\-&gt; At last my ‚ÄúKetlner channels‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Procedure :**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 1 : Forex Markets

&amp;#x200B;

[Eur-usd](https://preview.redd.it/848syozq72j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14cb27fe26c6818e1afbf67de147c95d735240d)

&amp;#x200B;

**Eur-usd :** Have you ever seen such a bearish chart in your life both on a weekly and monthly basis? I mean as much as I love European countries but I have to say your Eur-usd charts sucks equally much. Putin owns you guys this winter. Italy and Germany are already suffering so much with 10x bills gas + electricity if compared with 2021 so i can't even imagine about countries like Spain, Greece etc. Okay so I'm gonna stop myself now with the pessimism and dive into Technicals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Eur-usd bull traders have to stop this deadly weekly close otherwise the whole world is f‚Äôed.
* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.924.
* Stochastic RSI are about to cross weekly and go down.
* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over.‚Äô
* We aren‚Äôt even testing the Ketlner red upper band. That‚Äôs how bearish we are.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Eur-usd bull traders couldn't stop monthly support i.e 1.03. Rejected it, retested it from below and rejected it again. The double top at 1.24 was deadly too coz you know when we break the support at 1.03 you go down equally much. Hence those red vertical lines.
* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.81487 so is 0.834 vertical red line support.
* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain't coming out of there any time soon before weekly readjusts.
* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat for a while.
* We are hanging on the Ketlner upper red band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say with 1000% certainty that  Eur-usd is going down. Thank you madam Lagarde. You‚Äôre doing such a fine job by selling German Bund and buying Italian bonds. Congratulations to you and your PEP tool (Lol, guys this woman is bat-sh9t crazy)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Gbp-usd](https://preview.redd.it/yh25km1x72j91.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69b5b05bc7239d7a39983d46014631a715cbac77)

&amp;#x200B;

**Gbp-usd :** Well first Sir Mr Bailey. I have to say I'm a big fan of your honesty if you are reading this. I mean in today's world it's hard to find someone that honest in a government job. So guys we know inflation is double digit‚Äôs over here ( heading to 13% or was it 15% in coming months ) and in September the Bank of England is going with 50 bps. So we already know that Uk is gonna have more than 2Q of -ve Gdp. I hope you Uk folks survive considering you're gonna lose jobs, probably go into economic depression because recession is everybody‚Äôs base case even of Mr Bailey. So enough details let‚Äôs do analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Gbp-usd is in a huge IHS pattern but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will go to the upside that easily. Currently the price is testing right shoulder at 1.19. If it breaks then the price will test the head 1.14 and if it doesn‚Äôt break and holds then the price will go to 1.42 to test the neckline. After that we shall see whether the IHS breaks or not. Also the volume is supporting the down move.
* There is no Elliot wave here. But the key thing to note is that if 1.14 breaks then you‚Äôre heading to 0.87 levels. Reason being two vertical red lines should be equal.
* Stochastic RSI has crossed weekly and is about to go down.
* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over. If it doesn‚Äôt break only then you have a chance of at-least going to the neckline.
* The price action has occupied the whole Ketlner red band. Meaning we are in a bearish downtrend.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Just remember we are in the box lock of 1.14 to 1.42 range. The increasing volume is also supporting this downwards move. If i don't take any wicks into consideration then it looks like the price has broken 61.8% fib and would likely head downwards to 1 fib cause there is no support of candle closing. So watch out for monthly close here as well and an eye on higher high volume.  Also don't forget those red vertical lines. 1.72 - 1.42 , 1.42 - 1.14, so 1.14 - XXX. Do the math.
* 12345 was completed in Oct 2007 ( Yah that old ) From then we are in the ABC corrective wave. Elliot wave C is still deciding what‚Äôs gonna happen with IHS. If it breaks down you‚Äôre looking at 0.95.
* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain't coming out of here any time soon.
* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat.
* We are hanging on the Ketlner red upper band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say Gbp-usd is going down. Mr Soros if you‚Äôre listening to this, let's break the ‚ÄúBank of England‚Äù once again. Just for good old times sake.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Usd-Jpy](https://preview.redd.it/onbs70bf82j91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac73e6bdb79823496a0f762e30e2fb467f38af61)

&amp;#x200B;

**Usd-jpy :** If i tell you anything about this forex pair I‚Äôm probably Bs‚Äôing you. It‚Äôs true guys. Even Mr Kuruda the governor of Boj doesn‚Äôt know where the Usd-jpy is gonna go. But what we can speculate is if the dollar becomes so much stronger due to the weakness in the Eur-usd equation then Dxy is gonna pump past 110 and the dollar becomes stronger. Got it. So I could easily play this approach into my thesis by telling you yes this pair is just gonna go up. But I will not do that. Instead I'm gonna play a devil‚Äôs advocate here saying Usd-jpy will go down. So let‚Äôs analyze things which are a total waste of your and my time because I'm gonna reverse this forex you will see how.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Traders watch the 136. It‚Äôs a critical resistance. A clean break of it would mean 148 otherwise we go 125.
* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 and now we go for the ABC corrective wave. A will hit you at 116 and the rest is just a made up wave.
* Stochastic RSI is on bottom and will go up.
* Pvt(O) too looks like it could go up.
* Here in this Ketlner channel we are hanging on a lower green band. That‚Äôs how bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Traders watch the monthly close. If it closes above 136 we go to 148 otherwise down.
* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 wave. Entire ABC is made up because it all depends on the monthly close.
* Stochastic RSI is on top flying and looks overbought but who can argue with their unlimited bond buying which in turn has caused the parabolic move.
* Pvt(O) too looks like it could touch the blue line. If it crosses we fall, if not we go up.
* Here in this Ketlner channel we are on an upper green band. That‚Äôs how extremely bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.

&amp;#x200B;

So since I took the bear case it doesn't look like any bearish to me. Don't you agree? So our devil in devil‚Äôs advocate looks weak. So to fit our thesis lets reverse this. This is kinda like physics or Math kind of stuff where we proof things by assuming inverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say but I will say Jpy-usd is going up to 148 at my favorite dot com times where Dxy went 120. Hence i‚Äôm selling my Yen trust with ticker $FXY.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 2 : DXY. A basket of forex currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

You must be wondering, I'm gonna introduce another colorful RGB crayon drawing chart on both weekly and monthly. Sorry to disappoint you folks but I'm not doing that. Instead let‚Äôs use our brains.

We know that US dollar Index i.e. Dxy is used to measure the value of the dollar a/g basket of 6 currencies. The Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British pound and Swedish krona. Now I'm not gonna explain you here why dollar is global reserve currency or dollar has more liquidity so let‚Äôs just assume that.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens now is when Eur-usd becomes weaker, investors usually go risk off and buy the safest asset in the world i.e Dollar. Hence the Dxy goes stronger which suggests the dollar is getting stronger coz european buddies will exchange for dollars coz its very liquid and due to interest rate differentials. ( Remember Gbp-usd is an exception to interest rate differential coz what's happening over there is interest rates will go up but their currency is still losing its strength )  

&amp;#x200B;

We have discussed a thesis in past letters already and came to a conclusion and I quote.

‚ÄúEur-usd is a mirror image of the Dxy chart.‚Äù Remember this for your lifetime. Especially you Gen-z.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn‚Äôt gonna post a chart but then I realized I should for new folks who are lazy to read past posts. Eur-usd breaks parity and goes 0.80 levels Dxy will be 120 for sure. In monthly Dxy is super bullish. And on a weekly basis it's trying to close above 107 i believe. Hence your Voldemort asset class dropped -8% i guess. Right ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Mirror chart : DXY vs Eur-usd](https://preview.redd.it/pphup5l792j91.png?width=1637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a182585c747ec04f6078572bd4dab7091d12f81)

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say Dollar or  DXY is getting stronger in comparison to Euro, Gbp and Jpy. Hence DXY to 120 is back on the table according to the ‚Äú20yrs of wyckoff accumulation‚Äù pattern. If you cleanly break 110-112 i must say equities especially the Spx is gonna visit to my $3200 level.**

**Now some Cnbc or Bloomberg guys who stole my research and didn‚Äôt gave me credit 2-3 months ago used to come on tv and say things like ‚ÄúOh in 2018 Spx visited 200wMA so it makes sense that this cycle which is even more tightening compared to last makes sense to visit this range.‚Äù**

**So folks now the Spx has shifted its 200wMA/50mMA = $3500-$3600. But these clowns oops economists don't know that we should take a look at the monthly chart. Once you open that. Your pants are about to drop coz in the last tightening we visited not 200wMA but 100 monthly moving average i.e 100mMA. Yeah let‚Äôs go visit makachev vs oliviera in oct 23rd ufc 280. So if we cross paths over there I will tell you we are going to Spx $2873 i.e. somewhere around $2800-2900 which my close friend Dr Burry suggested too. Hence he sold + he is shorting coz he has relieved every moment in 2008. So he knows what‚Äôs coming next. You guys don‚Äôt.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 3 :Eur-usd  Implied Fed funds 100-CME:GEZ2023 ( Not gonna use Elliot wave + Fib trend starting here now )

&amp;#x200B;

This is like gonna be super high level stuff even far above my pay grade. Only Zoltan can explain this using repo markets but since he is busy I will try to explain it in a funny way. So if you might have watched Cnbc this past week two economists were arguing about how Fed funds have priced in 4% already but one might be saying no it has only priced in 3.4-3.5%. So who is right?

&amp;#x200B;

If you watch ‚ÄúEverything money‚Äù by my suggestion then Mo came to the conclusion that the reason he is saying 4% is because the Fed is doing QT + rate hikes which Mo still does not believe.

&amp;#x200B;

So who is right and what is the right explanation for 4% ?

Imo they both are right but the explanation is wrong. The reason one should present about the 4% Fed funds argument is that in Eur-usd implied Fed funds went to 4%. Hence the market has priced 4% in the euro dollar banking system. But if you take only the dollar banking system in Usa then we look at yields of 2 yr and 10 yr which are hinting that Fed funds 3.4-3.5% is already priced in by the markets.

&amp;#x200B;

[Eur-usd implied Fed funds.](https://preview.redd.it/1e44kz7n92j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed1184c16108f660d104edbd1ceac6e0b786f46)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly and weekly time frame analysis :

* Both look strong on a monthly and weekly basis. If monthly candle closes above resistance i.e. 3.50 this month then we are looking past 4% Eur-usd implied fed funds
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly and crossed and is heading up while on monthly they are about to cross and hover above for a while.
* Pvt(O) on weekly looks promising as compared to monthly.
* Both of them don‚Äôt wanna lose their lower green Ketlner band.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say that we are going up here technically. So J. Powell, could you please back me up on this. Zoltan agrees with me. Snyder doesn‚Äôt.** 

**( Just remember implied fed funds can go up due to Eur-usd weakness. So its kinda like indirect interest rate hike for markets. Add QT on top of that. Hence Fed is dovish in Fomc minutes for rate hikes )**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 4 : HYG &amp; LQD : The corporate bonds

&amp;#x200B;

[HYG](https://preview.redd.it/xwav70t8a2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b03c2b697eaabdb09728007e8699c1f158e40810)

&amp;#x200B;

Hyg : This product is designed to replicate a benchmark which provides a broad representation of the U.S. dollar-denominated high yield liquid corporate bond market. The high yield bond space has been cracked wide open by ETFs, as these products have offered numerous ways for investors to take advantage of this space. High yields can be a great addition to a yield-starved portfolio, as they can offer yields into the double digits for those willing to take on the risks that come along with it. The high returns come from riskier bond choices who have to pay out higher ratios to compensate investors for high risks. This means that the holdings of these ETFs will have higher chances of defaults, and could potentially leave investors out to dry. But those who have done their homework on the holdings of a particular ‚Äújunk‚Äù bond fund have the ability to generate strong returns from these powerful products. HYG keeps most of its assets inside of the U.S., though it does offer a slice of international exposure as well. The ETF is dominated by corporate bonds, the majority of which have investment grades between B and BB. This product will make a great income addition to any investor who is fully aware of the risks a high yield bond product carries.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* Weekly is gonna print bearish engulfing candle. Also there is a volume divergence. Price going up but volume going down which leads to fall. Trend line break candles will be the nail on the coffin.
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading down.
* Pvt(O) on weekly is also done after releasing supply and now will head down to accumulation..
* Ketlner middle line changing band rejected the price action suggesting bearish continuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly time frame analysis :

* Monthly rejected its previous to previous top of the candle and is gonna print another st. down red monthly. Again price ascending volume declining.
* But interestingly stochastic Rsi on monthly going up..
* Pvt(O) on monthly also about to cross its blue line later sometimes.
* As for Ketlner, well it's pretty much occupying the entire red lower band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

LQD : I leave it up to you guys. Cmon at least do one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going down on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going down because of that deadly candle that folks have been talking about.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 5 : IEI/HYG : Government bond price / Corporate bond price.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[IEI\/HYG : Double check below thing.](https://preview.redd.it/i3bbj0fda2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36056c59d1b790618d5af8006a9bafec16ea7884)

&amp;#x200B;

IEI/HYG : If it goes up then credit spreads are widening. ( Bad thing i.e risk off )

IEI/HYG : If it goes down then credit spreads are tightening. ( Good thing i.e. risk on )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* Weekly is about to print a bullish engulfing candle. Also volume isn‚Äôt supporting downwards move i.e. price is going down but volume is going down as well.
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading up.
* Can't comment about Pvt(O) weekly. Mixed signals
* Ketlner middle line changing band supported the price action and is green. Meaning bullish continuation

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly time frame analysis :

* No complete data on monthly that we can make assumptions.
* But stochastic Rsi crossed on monthly and suggested going down.
* Pvt(O) flat.
* As for Ketlner, well we had rejection from an extremely bullish green band i.e. we haven't gotten permission for capitulation but we got support from middle Ketlner to make the price go up again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going up on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going up.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 6 : ( Super scary ) : Velocity of m2 or m1 money supply i.e v = us gdp / m1 or m2.

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2](https://preview.redd.it/63y690uka2j91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=259b9d0855aacf6aae7f97a74591f5408b1ad7da)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very debatable topic. Only the pros have the right to argue about this stuff and no one else. Peter lynch once told me during my time travel visit that people worry that the velocity of money supply is going up way too fast then we are gonna have depression and if the velocity of money supply goes down then too we are gonna have depression. So which one is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways Q3 2020 : 1.149 was the highest reading. Currently we are trying to break it. Q2 2022 : 1.147

&amp;#x200B;

""The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. This is called an expanding economy."" \~ By Fred website.

&amp;#x200B;

So go out there and ask your banking friends and tell them please explain the concept of money supply in today's terms. Not an old term. So I too went to my brother for advice. He told me ‚Äú F off ‚Äú

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : ‚ÄúF off‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 7 : Gold

&amp;#x200B;

We are not gonna do weekly and monthly time frame analysis on this. Some of you guys may be like ‚ÄúDude, I'm an old man with agricultural land. I wanna own gold like my ancestors from 18th century coz i believe in stagflation, parabolic move, end of the world, negative debasement hedge blah blah‚Äù So i need charts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Old man's Gold :**

Old man you need to chill. We are gonna use our brain like Peter Schiff. So we know, gold doesn't love that his nemesis dollar is going up. Now if you can tell me how high Dxy will go up then i can tell you that the top of Dxy will be the bottom of Gold. Also gold doesn‚Äôt love financial crisis or bank runs. In my world gold is a phoenix who rises from ashes. Meaning if we plunge into the abyss then gold is gonna drag us out of there first. Then indices move and other asset classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Digital Gold :**

As for young folks, you love the King of Voldemort asset class don‚Äôt you? So go buy it at amazon bottom i.e. $4-5k or my favorite Richard heart level -83% i.e 10,690. Or if you really don't have the patience like probably 99% of the entire world population you buy some % of this commodity for whatever reasons these guys are selling you at $20k. I shall rest my case now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Gold down and vice versa.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 8 : TLT/JNK : It‚Äôs kinda like IEI/HYG

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys do this please? 

Hint : Bullish divergence on weekly and monthly. Meaning TLT ( 20yr treasury bond etf by black rock ) buying over Junk bonds i.e. JNK

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 9 : US Oil.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go Brandon and the government. Just how much are you gonna manipulate the best inflation hedge alive. You guys have already killed my Gold. Yes you J.P. Morgan traders, I hate you. May your bank dies in upcoming crash and have Panic of 2023 just like  Knickbocker crisis in 1907. Only then I shall have my vengeance a/g those rumors you circulated back in the days.

So guys you probably would know this that our Usa Government try to manipulate oil market just to please people and ask for votes. These are some of their stupid tactics.

&amp;#x200B;

* Releasing SPR ( i.e. Strategic petroleum reserve ) in the market.
* Pressurizing Saudis to find oil. ( Btw Saudi Armaco alone made profits greater than all Usa mega cap tech combined )
* Windfall taxes on Oil companies.
* Distributing E.V. credits to people. But even E.V. companies are smart. They instead increase their price. Ford I mean what the f you guys are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the most manipulated market I have ever seen in my 100 yr+ of lifetime. So traders if your conclusion from my above observation was that we should short Oil lemme tell you something in double quotes.

‚ÄúBe afraid of Putin‚Äôs Winter Oil boogeyman‚Äù. ""Contango is a dangerous thing that futures creates""

&amp;#x200B;

You don‚Äôt short Oil in winter. Period. Heck you shouldn‚Äôt even trade Oil. Only the expert can do this because it's called ‚ÄúWidow Maker‚Äù i.e. the losses in this commodity trading could be catastrophic planetary devastation like.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip : Btw currently oil is in downwards wedge and it could break to upside and we go up in winter but Oil too like gold doesn't love Dxy going up. So kinda mixed signals i guess. Let's see who shall prevail bulls or bears of oil.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Oil down and vice versa but Winter is coming/ Contango = Maybe Oil up.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 10 : Powell curve i.e.10 yr - 3 month, 2 yr - 3 month ( Pvt(o) and Elliot wave doesn't work here )

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys remember the talk we had with Powell earlier this year when he was trying to explain us that the inversion of the 10 yr - 2 yr curve doesn't mean anything and unless the near term curve inverts it's all okay. Well folks Powell near time curves are close to getting inverted. Therefore you‚Äôre seeing these Fed officials talk dovish recently. Coz if they invert Fed will lose their remaining 0.0000001% credibility. So let‚Äôs analyze them on a weekly time frame because on a monthly time frame they look super super bearish to me and there is no chance that the curve won‚Äôt invert at some point later on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[J Powell\/ Fed Curves : Us10y-Us03m , Us02y-Us03m](https://preview.redd.it/djrc8jaf83j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d99ee474cadfaa810f9d14a4dd3ac350a9591a)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* The current weekly candle in both curves are going to close lower than previous week which could suggest further downside risk.
* Stochastic Rsi on 10yr-3m looks flat dead whereas on 2yr-3m it looks like it is rising.
* MacD in both of them is showing us that the downwards declining move is losing its strength.
* As for Ketlner, well in both of them they are staying in the lower red band suggesting they are still in a bearish trend.

&amp;#x200B;

Larry Summers former Fed chairman came recently to Bloomberg saying that the Fed has shown in latest minutes that they don‚Äôt even know what they are doing. Hence they Bs‚Äôing us in their statement. I mean guys just read these hawkish and dovish points yourself. Also do check out the hidden statements in minutes which are pieces of advice for billionaires about liquidity and t-bills. Don‚Äôt forget my warning about bank runs. They are coming. My bet is Well‚Äôs Fargo Oct 2022/23 = Lehman brothers Oct 2008 or you could also go with lowest read by a bank in Fed stress test.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hawkish vs Dovish vs Billionaire's \( Highlighted in blue \) Fed minutes.](https://preview.redd.it/omb5j3ws83j91.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6158e6604b455fbd85a1d9a922db7ce00ec1e833)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for individual bonds and overall yield curve : 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonds :**

* Well 10 yr yields looks so good on both weekly and monthly time frame. So we go up in yields.
* 2 yr yields  look so good on weekly and waiting for monthly close making it bullish. Meaning on September Fed is gonna be dead. ( Yields will rise meaning bond prices go down with stocks )

Note : Once again i'm telling yields is going up due to Eur-usd down i.e. Dxy up and markets front running 95B/m QT. We are quite unsure about rate hikes coz its nearly 50-50 b/w 50 and 75 bps. It will all depend on Cpi and Jobs data in September.

&amp;#x200B;

* Institutions and Hf‚Äôs are also buying Chinese bonds like crazy or maybe Chinese themselves because of fear of recession and growth slowdown i.e. flight to safety trade. They have deflationary recession but the thing is they have balance sheet recession. So their government is creating a liquidity trap by cutting rates. But don't forget they can always do  exuberance amount of liquidity coz they have very less inflation. In Usa you're getting rekt in both stocks and bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yield curve :**

* As for the entire yield curve here look at these beauties that Powell has created in these charts.

&amp;#x200B;

[Credits : Eurodollar University. By Jeff Snyder](https://preview.redd.it/in4k23tl83j91.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8d4fbef2d512895f7d20db2b348b80b9907ebe)

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Yield should be higher if the time horizon is higher. Meaning shorter end like 2 yr to 5 yr should yield less than 10 yr and 20 yr normally due to unknown risks associated in far future. But look here in these charts. A 52 w t-bill is yielding more than 20 yr and 10 yr bonds. That‚Äôs insane. It tells us there is a danger in next 1-2yrs as compared to far in future. The curve has gone banana's b/w 26 w t-bill to 10 yr bond. After 10 yr to 20 yr curve looks so good and why won't it. Because after the most horrible decade in entire history of Usa will come a little less horrible decade. Haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say yields are going up in respective bonds. But will basic yield curve i.e us10y-us02y will steepen or invert more is out of my pay grade.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 11 : VIX. It looks so ready to pop anytime.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean what do i even say here. This whole year traders are buying Vix calls in 20 and shorting equities and as the Vix goes 30 they sell their calls and buy puts. Meanwhile longing their equities position.

So smart Vix traders, it's time to integrate the mega crash in your calculations. Meaning do the first phase of second part but leave tf out of second phase of second part i.e. don't buy puts on Vix and don't try to long equity in 30 coz this time folks are going to promised Vix 40+.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Vix is going up. Reason : It's mid terms + Putin x Jinpig x Biden at G8 = Volatility in Sept - Nov.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Conclusion :**

&amp;#x200B;

Financial derivation = Take those steps into consideration that you are confident in your analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

**So I chose my Eur-usd pokemon.**

Reason : I am quite confident in my analysis and Lagarde. Plus Fed minutes made a commentary about this that dollar is looking so strong as comparison to Euro. Maybe this too played a part in their recent dovish commentary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assuming :** Eur usd is going down coz Europe is f‚Äôed. ( We were most confident about this in all of our steps. Also my birdie told me 0.93 eur-usd traders have risen from their grave in options market )

&amp;#x200B;

**Above assumption ( proving in step 1 t.a. ) will mean :**

* Dxy go up due to the mirror chart theory.  ( 0.80-0.90 levels in eur-usd = 120 move in Dxy )

&amp;#x200B;

* So now equities, commodities, metals and rest other asset class will fall down.

&amp;#x200B;

But what about bonds?

&amp;#x200B;

* Well when the dollar strengthens then the countries who have dollar denominated debts have to sell their bonds and buy new bonds to refinance. Something like that. I think i butchered it. But yah it happens. Other reason being when dollar strengthens due to ext factors then its kinda like a rate hike. So since bonds don't like rate hike they sell off. Now add QT on top of it i.e 95B/m  + Us treasury will issue more long term bonds and cut treasury bill issuance. So 10yr to 20yr bond yields will go up.
* So now remains the case for 2yr bonds. The Fed will hike rates but it's kinda hinting that they won't go aggressive now coz they don't wanna overshoot and bring depression. Hence the 2yr bond will not go up more than the back end i.e. 10yr bond. Meaning us10y-us02y will move from inversion territory to steepening territory.
* T-bills is getting bought more instead of rrp. Hence t-bills are trading below rrp. Meaning billionaires or banks fear about incoming liquidity crisis or collateral shortage. So t-bills it is or cashola. Or you could go to a money market fund and park your money there coz banks don't give you anything. Let's cause bank run together next year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Also vix will pop up in this scenario due to asset classes being sold off

&amp;#x200B;

* The velocity of m2 is gonna go up suggesting economy expands. Nope. Imo its suggesting dollar milkshake theory coz m2 is going down. Less dollars will be in circulation but exchanges will remain same. ( Long shot. I really don't know. Just guessing )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Final Result :**

&amp;#x200B;

Every step we proved above using technical analysis on weekly and monthly time frame is being backed by my financial derivation except one thing. Will us10y-us02y curve invert more or steepen.? Coz steepening is bad for dollar strength whereas more inversion is good for dollar strength i.e. Dxy.

P.s. I think i'm so confused. Damn these bonds are tough to read.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : I forgot Dr copper. Lol. Why is it going up when Gold and other metals is going down?

\*\*\* Illuminati said : ""Coz Dxy move up or bond yields move up is not because of rate hikes. They all are priced in. It's because of pseudo rate hikes on the Global market that is causing dollar to strengthen. This is due to QT + Eur-usd , Gbp-usd going down. Throw Japanese yen in there too but its chart is going up coz its Usd-jpy pair not Jpy-usd. Just like i said before too. 

&amp;#x200B;

wallstreetbet,"All bets on GrantGreetings WSB,

Firstly, I would like to thank the community for sparking my interest in investing and giving me the opportunity to create this post. I‚Äôm not looking for any pity, I possess the courage and motivation to push through my current situation and get back on my feet.

I believe some subtle honesty is the best way to explain my situation. I‚Äôve been homeless for the past two weeks and staying in a street shelter. I have $71, my clothes, and my guitar. I start another job in two weeks and have a lot of down time on my hands. I know there is no secret formula or fail proof method when it comes to investing. That being said, I want to take 50$ of what I have left and start learning at the very least. We all have to start somewhere. I am a 30 years old, sober, and a college graduate. I never thought I would be in this situation, but here I am. Time to fight my way out.

If you had 50$ left to your name, a whole lot of down time, and a hell of a lot of motivation, where would you start?"

wallstreetbet,"tesla releases new fsd versionHere is the summary of few features, if you want to know more about the release notes

Kindly check -&gt; https://twitter.com/teslascope/status/1561225935004635136?s=20&amp;t=9qw6bQB33aGKqjr_yq3jrw

Quick Summary notes of new fsd version

Added a new ‚Äúdeep lane guidance‚Äù module to the Vector Lanes neural network which fuses features extracted from the video streams with coarse map data, i.e. lane counts and lane connectivities. This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities become visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.

Improved overall driving smoothness, without sacrificing latency, through better modeling of system and actuation latency in trajectory planning. Trajectory planner now independently accounts for latency from steering commands to actual steering actuation, as well as acceleration and brake commands to actuation. This results in a trajectory that is a more accurate model of how the vehicle would drive. This allows better downstream controller tracking and smoothness while also allowing a more accurate response during harsh maneuvers.

Improved unprotected left turns with more appropriate speed profile when approaching and exiting median crossover regions, in the presence of high-speed cross traffic (‚ÄúChuck Cook style‚Äù unprotected left turns). This was done by allowing an optimizable initial jerk, to mimic the harsh pedal press by a human when required to go in front of high-speed objects. Also improved lateral profile approaching such safety regions to allow for a better pose that aligns well for exiting the region. Finally, improved interaction with objects that are entering or waiting inside the median crossover region with better modeling of their future intent.

Added control for arbitrary low-speed moving volumes from Occupancy Network. This also enables finer control for more precise object shapes that cannot be easily represented by a cuboid primitive. This required predicting velocity at every 3D voxel. We may now control for slow-moving UFOs.

Upgraded Occupancy Network to use video instead of images from single time step. This temporal context allows the network to be robust to temporary occlusions and enables the prediction of occupancy flow. Also, improved ground truth with semantics-driven outlier rejection, hard example mining, and increasing the dataset size by 2.4x.

Upgraded to a new two-stage architecture to produce object kinematics (e.g. velocity, acceleration, yaw rate) where network compute is allocated O(objects) instead of O(space). This improved velocity estimates for far away crossing vehicles by 20%, while using one-tenth of the compute.

Increased smoothness for protected right turns by improving the association of traffic lights with slip lanes vs yield signs with slip lanes. This reduces false slowdowns when there are no relevant objects present and also improves yielding position when they are present.

Reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks. This was done with an improved understanding of pedestrian and bicyclist intent based on their motion"

BBBY  has less emotional ties to its shareholders. Who the F cares about bathroom crap of WSB was a bunch of moms and maids i would say we have a shot, most of you never clean your dirty filthy bathroom. Do you even shower? Living in moms basement  do you even own the rights of that bathroom ?.

2. The market environment got this never happening squeeze are just not present.  When free money, hyperinflation was present, retards could afford billboards and planes.  Today market conditions are not present for such type squeeze. Yoi have what about 2-4  weeks before 2  rate hikes come through? 75 bps or 100 bps this only means that the cost of borrowing will increase. The 80$ price target if it ever gets there and highly likely not,  is  peanuts compared to GMEs run and still potential run. 


3.  There is just not enough retards with enough money  anymore .  It use to be the case, but most rich gamblers have already lost plenty trying to chase the 100000000 countless other stocks you all tried to pump as a squeeze container.  Rememver RKT ? Clov ? SNDL ? SPCe ? More and more....  ahh these where good times. Many people who have a mortgage gotta renew with higher interest rates, many with debt gotta pay it back with higher interest rates. Many of you who have a job, likely aren't all the secure knowing your boss everyday is thinking if he should fire some of you.  This is the cycle of printing money, this is the cycle of an economy contracting. 


4. There is not enough institutional gamblers, mostly for reason #2 and #3. 


Remember when the price target for gme was  suppose to be over 1000$ ? Which ever dumbas believed that held on.  Those who were smart sold when it was few hundred dollars.

One of the most prominent market bears has provided a glowing endorsement of AMC Entertainment Holdings‚Äô (NYSE: AMC) special dividend strategy ‚Äì known as the APE split.

* ‚Äú**AMC proves your finance professor wrong, and we know why‚Ä¶ AMC‚Äôs debtholders are institutional credit investors concerned with downside risk, who see negative cashflow, massive leverage, and a long and uncertain return to profitability. Equity holders are different.""**
* ‚Äú**Critics were quick to point out the APE split was merely a way to get around the common share authorization limit and issue more equity.**¬†***This is precisely the point.*** **Far from ‚Äúhiding the ball, management has been upfront about their intention to raise additional equity via APEs.""**
* ""**While The AMC Entertainment APE split has been met with uncertainty and doubt over the impact of dilution on shareholders, this is misinformed. Since AMC‚Äôs equity today is much cheaper than its debt, we don‚Äôt even need to run numbers to know that issuing equity to repay debt would be accretive.""**"

wallstreetbet,"Serious discussion question: What happens if GME buys BABY with stock?Say they issue 1.5b worth of shares to BBBY. Is this good or bad for BBBY in the long run?

 The good part for GME is that the dilution gets a profitable company so their projected earnings and valuation may increase simultaneous to the dilution and not change the stock price much. I‚Äôm struggling to see the good for BBBY as they lose their profitable arm unless there is a revenue sharing agreement in place.

They would hold GME  stock they could borrow against or sell if it increases over time. Still short on runway doesn‚Äôt change much. Am I missing something here?"

And RC Ventures? Also doesn‚Äôt have the capital and I find it hard to believe RC would have RC Ventures throw down billions on this play.

It seems weird to me that:

- data that RC filed (intent to ) sell came up when the stock was up 600%

- after hours fell 40%

- all meme stocks fell with it 

- the story of the 20year old making 100 million

- the story pushed by all major news that it plunged 40%.


I dont like conspiracies or any bullshit going around in this sub from 16year olds that dont go out in the weekends and trade , but something fishy is going on here. It is as if someone is trying to press the narrative that the upside is done.


Points that contradict anything above:

- WHY the ff didnt RC tweet that he hasnt sold or something to indicate that he is still there? If you have nothing to say you are silent.

- big money enter trades in meme stocks  as data shows they move together. After hours  explained

This is why they created a RED week of bloodbath market, to stop the squeeze.(bbby, fubotv, ehab...)

They didn't predict that small and middle investors will return back in august.

I guess that BBBY shorts now are between 65%-80%.

They will cover 5 days before the day of publication of short statistics (1 septmeber), to avoid the market reaction.

If statistics shows that short are always above 40% then this war will not have a stop until another squueze which will not be predicted by anyone.

If you already sold your position in BBBY and wanna be back. Maybe 8$ will be the best apes support to HODL until that day will come (very soon) (2 weeks max).

Maybe i am saying sh..it sometimes,
You just need to think like cramer if you were shorting bbby. What gonna be the market reaction if they notice that (bbby, fubo, ehab....) Are the most shorted stock.

Investors are no more interesseted to get invole in small variation stocks, (delta, tesla...). 

We spent 6 month of hodling during the last crisis , so we used to see red numbers , and most of small investors are ready to gamble than make small investissement.

Well we might be there already. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I need to get something off my chest‚Ä¶ I generally refrain from talking politics, and especially making political posts, however I need to say this.  
&gt;  
&gt;What I‚Äôm going to post is real, not somebody that a friend‚Äôs, cousin‚Äôs, sister‚Äôs, neighbor has happening to them‚Ä¶  
&gt;  
&gt;I own a small trucking company, and this is what the fuel crisis is doing to our country‚Ä¶ so this directly affects me, you, our children, our country.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today I filled up my truck to deliver products that help keep our country fed. When I filled up my truck, it cost me $1,149.50. This is ONE truck, for ONE day of fuel. I own three. So for one day of operation, it‚Äôs costing me $3,448.50. (Yes, we use a full tank of fuel every single day, sometimes more than 1 tank per day)  
&gt;  
&gt;My trucks generally run 5-6 days a week, so we‚Äôll just estimate on the low side and say 5. That‚Äôs $17,242.50. Last week was over $20k for ONE week, that I have to pay out of my pocket to try and keep not only my children fed, but those of my employees, and our country.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mark my words, we are on a downhill slide to the worst recession our country has ever seen. If you don‚Äôt believe me, I implore you to do your research.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trucking companies are going under left and right. (Literally hundreds weekly) If you‚Äôre not aware, what you‚Äôre wearing, what you‚Äôre eating, what you‚Äôre living in, what you‚Äôre driving, what you‚Äôre reading this on, was delivered by a truck.  
&gt;  
&gt;If something drastic doesn‚Äôt change in the next few weeks/months, I promise you, you‚Äôll see empty shelves everywhere you look. You‚Äôll see chaos as people fight for the basic necessities of everyday life. Food, medicine, etc...  
&gt;  
&gt;If something doesn‚Äôt change, I pray that all of you have the ability, knowledge, and skills to fend for yourselves. Not only against those who would do you or your family harm, but to be able to find sustainable food and water.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a scary time. Not only for small business owners, but every single American.  
&gt;  
&gt;Truck drivers are out here going for broke, holding onto something we know this country needs.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if you know a truck driver, please tell them to hold on as long as they can. Our country won‚Äôt survive without them‚Ä¶"

Global oil tanker rates jolt higher on high fuel prices, risk premium¬†

¬†(Reuters) - Oil tanker rates are soaring globally as traders scramble to cope with jitters over possible disruption in Russian supplies, as well as war risk premiums for ships plying the Mediterranean region following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Shipowners are also grappling with higher fuel costs after oil prices soared nearly $2 per barrel on Friday, with Brent back above $100. The global energy sector is concerned that Europe and the United States may impose sanctions on Russian exports and severely disrupt supplies.

Sources were also worried that any additional widening in sanctions could render some Russian oil and fuel supplies off-limits, and trigger a scramble by fuel and oil traders to secure alternative supplies that could tie up vessels on trips to exporters outside the Black Sea region


Fuel tanker rates from the United States to Europe jumped more than 8% on Thursday, surging to their highest level since May 2020. The cost of bunkering fuel at the world's largest bunkering hub Singapore jumped 6% on Thursday to $555 per tonne, the highest since 2019.

""I'm expecting quite a mess at the moment,"" a Singapore-based fuel trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""The war risk premium is expected to increase. Also, quite a lot of Russian cargoes that are intended to load might be cancelled too.""

Rates for one Trafigura-chartered vessel carrying crude oil from Houston to Rotterdam -- the Navig8 Precision -- climbed about $200,000 to $1.9 million, or World Scale 150 compared with 135 earlier this week, according to sources and shipping data.

Rates for another vessel, the Pluto Moon, carrying crude oil from Africa to the United Kingdom, have increased by 83 World Scale points to $2 million.

Top buyers of Russian oil are struggling to secure credit guarantees at Western banks, or find ships to take crude oil from one of the world's largest producers.

At least three major buyers of Russian oil were unable to open letters of credit from Western banks to cover purchases on Thursday, four trading sources said, citing market uncertainty after the Russian invasion.¬†read more

Rates for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) from the Middle East to China, Asia's benchmark for crude freight, rose 4.77 Worldscale (W) to 38.82W on Friday, a shipbroker said, referring to points on the pricing index operated by the Worldscale Association that is used as an industry tool to calculate freight charges. Each VLCC can carry 2 million barrels of oil.

Global oil and fuel tanker rates jolt higher after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine

Shipowners are concerned about rising bunker fuel prices and have asked for higher freight rates, while owners of mid-sized Aframax tankers who have ships plying the Mediterranean are worried about war risk premiums, the broker added, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

""Activities (in the East) are quiet for now. But we will know gradually how the freight market picks up further,"" another shipbroker, based in Singapore, said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

On the Arab Gulf-Japan (TC1) route for vessels that can carry about 75,000-90,000 tonnes of clean products, rates have climbed to 77.5 Worldscale (W), compared with 75 last week, he added.

The shipping index benchmark for Long-Range 1 (LR1) vessels which can carry 55,000 tonnes of clean products from the Middle East to Japan, also known as TC5, rose to 102.5W as of Friday, up from 97.5W last week.

Greece recommended all Greek ships immediately leave Ukraine and Russia territorial waters in the Black Sea, ship brokers and a senior Greek maritime ministry official said Thursday. It could lower rates in regions where the ships move, a shipping source said.

My uneducated and retarded self as a very simple question ..... why do they feel so compelled to warn us about this?

DID THEY WARN US BEFORE THESE:

* Market / Real Estate Crash of 07-09
* Dot Com Bubble Burst of 00-02
* Interest Rate Increase Recession of 90-92

wallstreetbet,"Russel 2022 Preliminary Index Additions and Deletions and CLOVSummary: Yearly Reconstitution of the Russell Index could provide juicy opportunities by looking at the addition and deletion list. As a CLOV bag holder, I am playing CLOV.

\* Do your own DD, your mileage may very, past performance... (All that stuff)

\-----------------------------

In the world of buying short term options, this event screams of guaranteed good times. On Friday at 6pm eastern, Russell released their preliminary list of additions and deletions to their index.

Additions - [https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru3000\_additions\_20220603.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru3000_additions_20220603.pdf)

Deletions - [https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru3000\_deletions\_20220603.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru3000_deletions_20220603.pdf)

Russell Reconstitution Timeline - [https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2022-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2022-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule)

Focusing on additions( and only looking at daily highs) here are some statistics on last years index update.

https://preview.redd.it/08u6nhp1in391.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd67cb0ab15966b0180619b3c8b2d0ae023dbae3

Of the 253 that were in the final addition list I was only able to pull data for 244 for yahoo. Of the 244 all but 2 had a higher high laser in the month as compared to June 4th(the day the list was released last year). The average monthly high was nearly 20% higher than the close price on June 4th(The high for the 2000 index was up 2.8% as compared to June 4th). On average the high for the month was reached almost 12 calendar days after June 4th.

Why does the Russell impact prices, because there are tons of indexes that track it. Most of the additions and deletions are from the Russell 2000. Here is a short list, but every bank that manages IRA's or 401k's also probably has their own index fund. If they want to match it officially, the new list becomes gospel on June 27th.

https://preview.redd.it/7wjqamysmn391.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c5cb77622b4208513b48cb67d0fd492d5cfbf3

If you can time the highs(and maybe the lows with deletions) you can turn a quick buck with options.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Trigger Warning, the flowing analysis looks specifically at CLOV |

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a bag holder(and long term believer) of CLOV and fully invested, I have purchased $3 calls for June 10th and July 1st to attempt to take advantage of a possible short term price increase (I also hold leaps and shares).

[Bought these at almost 3x those prices :\(](https://preview.redd.it/xosgxbbivn391.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbf9e1ab948bb2cbf1193c8110c578542b3b5bc9)

Last year on June 4th the close price for CLOV was $9.00 and on June 9th it hit $28.85. Now this was in the meme heyday and CLOV was significantly shorted and only had monthly options that went up to the mid 20's. On June 10th is was announced that CLOV would not be added due to voting rights. By the end of the month CLOV was back in the low teens and has steadily fallen under $3 today.

https://preview.redd.it/37gpb7c1mn391.png?width=661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e752aef2555d622f1a21a1fdf4e2fb793ff93822

The list for 2022 came out and CLOV is once again on it. This year they should stay on it as the voting issue has been resolved. Will history repeat it self, yes and no(only my opinion). Will it hit $28 this month, NO. Will is nearly 3x this month, NO. I don't think it will squeeze, but I think there is some option activity will will help to support momentum of the price going up as a result of addition to the Russell $3000. I could see $3.5 - $4 as very reasonable. Let's look at some option data I have been collecting since November.

First lets look at historical open interest:

https://preview.redd.it/l1mewbacpn391.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70663acba8c602286b80e9659f37eda93d64fbfd

Here we can see that general option interest is decreasing. We can also see the expiration of the monthly options pretty clearly as well. This doesn't hint at much, but we can see that the last day on the chart June 3rd does have a slight up tick without account yet from option expirations and volume from Friday.

So lets look at volume:

https://preview.redd.it/szko7vcsqn391.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a916e37d359ee97bcebd0ab721fc195abd67b2e

Here we can see a spike in call volume, while not significant to anything seen in November, it is the highest since March. Because the open interest did not spike the day after the volume jump, I believe that options were being rolled to different dates and/or prices. One way we can holistically look at the option data is to look at the total gamma. For this I run a script that takes in to consideration every open contact and multiplies it by that option's gamma.

https://preview.redd.it/6tj1guvisn391.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b01589e354cf7e732a082744513424ba942c9b6

Here we can see a spike in gamma on Friday, this alone also doesn't mean much. Gamma increases share price momentum only if those option are being delta hedged. Both puts and calls impact the momentum as puts can be delta hedged using shorts, and the further from in the money the put option is, the more shorts they will close. With likely price jump from the Russel addition, it is likely that they gamma will actually come in to play in the total deltas. If price doesn't change, gamma doesn't matter as it is momentum based.

As a purely speculative exercise, because the way I run the script by taking open interest x gamma we can really multiply the number on the chart by 100 to see the total change in total delta. In this case just using calls, that is 14.5 million shares if 100% of the options were delta hedged.(Very unlikely)

# Conclusion

Playing CLOV with the Russell additions is a lottery ticket like most options plays. I think it hitting a high of $4 this month is completely reasonable even if it doesn't stick short term. With $3 call break evens at $3.03 and $3.10 for the June 10th and July 1st expiration respectively, I may add a few more.

The significance of the July 1st option is that it is the first Friday after the new Russell list become official.

wallstreetbet,"SP500 and Nasdaq Charts WeekendLets start with monthly charts of NQ and ES . We are in a down trend from Jan 2022 high but this week close has brought a close below the trendline from 2016 ( pink line). Fed has started QT this month and will continue on a weekly basis ([Fed balance sheet](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm)). also the monthly MACD is bearish ( see in chart). Bottom yellow lines are likely support for ES and NQ around (8500 for NQ ) and (3260 &amp; 2820) for ES.  Lots of headwind if you are a bull. We are also going into earning season for stocks in June/July and will have blackout period for most stocks.  CPI data comes next Friday on June 10th and VIX expiration on June 15th followed by FOMC on June 17th. A likely downside move will start after VIX expiration and June 17th opex.

[ES Monthly ](https://preview.redd.it/7diyfbpzon391.png?width=1599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c0e2dc9a89749bf25e526be172b1faae1725f66)

Lets see weekly Chart:

ES has hit the trend line resistance 4140-4200. Once the downtrend resumes our first line of support is around 3700. if 3700 does not hold than we will retest pre pandemic high around 3380 and support at 3260s. if that does not hold we will likely reach long term support at 2800's. 

[ES Weekly](https://preview.redd.it/lpwdcctwqn391.png?width=1601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=846ea8b6d81d6f68c00c017d74b84001df97d292)

NQ has hit trend line resistance around 12800( pink line) . We should see some support around 11000 and if that breaks we will retest pre pandemic high at 9600's and 9100 and 8500. 8500 is also the bottom of the trend line ( yellow) where it will likely reach a support to end this round of down trend.

[NQ Weekly](https://preview.redd.it/y30sm9twqn391.png?width=1606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2c0972f4d97ec3be2383499cbe0b0f30025f119)

Triggers that can end the down trend:

Fed fund rate is likely to raise 0.5 in June and July and September is likely a toss up for 0.5 or 0.25. By end of July the Fed rate would be around 1.75-2.00 %.  A 2% rate would likely top out and potentially lead to a fund or bank collapse.

&amp;#x200B;

what will reverse the trend ?

1) Fed has to pause raising rates or start QE - market has to think that Fed will pause 

2) Stocks will limit up once fed starts QE or cut rates just like when LTCM blew out in 1990's  and fed stepped in."

Hi,  On GME I was in about $6 and out $12, I bot it on value plus the fact it was hyper shorted. This was before even heard of WallStreet Bets. If had any idea would have held 50% for the fireworks.

Many people chase worthless or way over valued stocks just because it is going up or ""I have a hunch and am going to bet a bunch"" as Rick Rule calls it. I have seen that for decades. Tried to warn people online about the dotcom bust that was coming in 2000..

**If you buy a stock (company) that has 20% or 30% or 40% annual profits or EBITDA yield you get a built-in 20% or 30% or 40% edge each year.**  That is what  I do, most stocks I invest in have those type of yields and I often get 5 baggers, 10 baggers or better.   Right now have a 30+ bagger in Petrus and a 20+ bagger in TGA. You can see my broker statements that back up my profit claims above in title on this post, in the below article.

**Globex Gets Big Royalties For Free, A Deep Value Stock For The Commodity Super Cycle**

[https://ceo.ca/@geodan/globex-gets-big-royalties-for-free-a-deep-value-stock-for-the-commodity-super-cycle](https://ceo.ca/@geodan/globex-gets-big-royalties-for-free-a-deep-value-stock-for-the-commodity-super-cycle)

&amp;#x200B;

It has an EV/EBITDA yield over 60%.   Here is how the article starts:

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**     Globex is a mining royalty company and a mine and mining claim wheeler/dealer with high growth, and deep value, and that is in the right place at the right time.

Globex often gets a 3% GMR, or Gross Metal Royalty, not the more normal 1% NSR. Since they sell the properties for a profit, those massive royalties are for free.

A 3% GMR is extremely valuable, if a mine they sell produces $2 billion in sales at a 10% profit ($200 million) Globex will get $60 million or 30% of the profits yet has no risk nor investment. If a client miner sells $2 billion of minerals and loses $50 million, Globex will still make the $60 million in profits.

They have over 200 mining properties and dozens of royalties yet are at a dirt-cheap valuation of Allen EV/EBITDA of 1.55, ROCE of 1,926%, Current Ratio of 131 and with Sales Growth of 335%.

Due to having so many deals in place Globex will be a legitimate drilling results news machine on steroids. They pay nothing for the drilling yet benefit greatly when results are good. If 15 clients drill in a year Globex gets the news flow from all of them. 

There is only one other deep-value company I know of that gets mining royalties for free. That is GoldSpot. I have a large position in both and think both are outstanding investments.

Globex has high insider ownership and a long record of avoiding dilution and wasteful spending.

wallstreetbet,"Preface: Amazon recently had a 20:1 stock split this past Friday (taking affect on Monday). Google has its upcoming 20:1 split slated for mid-July.&amp;#x200B;

Do you see any potential in the recent Amazon split and upcoming Google 20:1? Are these Blue Chips, stocks that our dads wished they invested in before the price was to high for the average investor, going to be more attractive now that they are ""affordable"". I know that splits are have no intrinsic value, it doesn't mean that they are actually ""cheaper"" but it does have a phycological affect on average traders who don't have millions to invest. I'm more inclined to purchase Amazon and Google at $100+ and own ""more"" whole shares, than spend limited capital on a few or have fractional share (I'm with TD, so I don't have the ability to purchase fractional shares yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my strategy was to purchase Amazon option calls before the split, that expire next Friday (Jun 10), with expectations that the price will go up next week. I also purchased Google calls well in advance anticipating the price will go up in the weeks prior to the split. These calls expire the day of the split and some in August.

So when that okay looking girl messaged me on instagram asking how my day is going, I took her for a bot instantly. I checked how to break an instagram bot on Google and thought that it would be cool if I succeeded at breaking it (yes I know I'm retarded and have too much free time).  
But, as it turned out, it wasn't a bot. We chatted for like 3-4 days and she is really trying hard to get me to believe her that Forex and \*internetcoin\* trading is absolutely safe and risk-free and to register on their trading platform, centurycapitaltrade . com. I did a background check, and all I can see are people being scammed by them and them being black listed by some UK security.

wallstreetbet,"Orderflow 101Happy Saturday degens,


In this post, we are going to dive into the overall view of what is order flow? I will discuss some of the tools, some of the concepts and ideas behind it, and help define the general concept of what order flow is and how it can possibly be utilized in your trading.

Alright, let's dive in. So, order flow, what is it? Order flow trading involves visualizing the interactions between the buyers and sellers, in order to identify control of the current auction. The rawest form of order flow activity is visualized with the time and sales- also known as the tape.  As buy and sell volume enter the market, that relationship of how they interact, can give an individual an edge or a map of who is controlling the auction, and who is most interested in aggressively entering position.

Why would we use it? Well, it is non-lagging, it is not a moving average, itis not anything that is delayed. It comes straight across your screen in an immediate stance, from a centralized order book, the futures. Centralized order book means that there‚Äôs no hidden orders out there. All of the orders are displayed right in front of your face on the Depth of Market. And that relationship helps you really gauge an understanding of what is occurring in the current environment.

So, what are some order flow tools? Well, this is a non-exhaustive list, but some common tools utilized are: Time &amp; Sales, Depth Of Market or the DOM, Volume Profile, Delta (It can be delta by price, could be cumulative delta, different forms of delta), and also Footprint Candles. These are out-of-the-box tools which are available in almost every major charting platform. So, let's dive into each category of tool further.. The DOM and the time and sales are certainly the basis of order flow trading. On the DOM, the depth of market, what you‚Äôre actually seeing is a list of resting orders. That data in the book is used to determine which transactions can be processed, and engage the transactions that are occurring as they occur. What we can see here is the resting sell side here in red, and the resting buy side on the right. Over here on the left, we can actually further break up those order quantities and see: are there some orders that are larger and waiting? Or are they conglomerates of smaller sizing? Asthat activity transacts back and forth, it helps us gauge an understanding of low risk areas to interact with the market.

The Time &amp; Sales shows volume, price direction, and the timestamp of the actual trade data that has transacted. And so you can see here, you see a time/price that the transaction occurred and the volume itself. The coloring also tells you a bit of a story: were they aggressive? Did they jump up and buy it at the market? Did they dive down and sell it at market? Or are they waiting there and just filling their positioning?

Now this comes through quickly but all of this activity is essentially starting here in the resting order book. A. A way that we look at this and start to form a story is by putting the Time &amp; Sales and resting order book, or DOM, side by side. On the left here, you can see the DOM sitting directly next to the tape. Although it seems a little overwhelming if you‚Äôre not used to looking at this information, it tells a very clear story of who is actually sitting on the book, what is occurring at a particular level of interest, and where the auction could be going or if we are reaching a potential point of exhaustion.

Next, we are going to talk about the volume profile. Volume acts as interest in the market. You can clearly see areas where there is more volume, and areas where there is less volume. Now the volume is displayed vertically against price rather than at the bottom. This tells us that certain price levels where there is more or less interest. is the level of interest is particularly useful in both intraday trading and on larger timeframes. Using the volume profile, we can see where interest dwindles, and where there was high interest that may attract price back to that area.  Also, it tells us where there was no interest in facilitating trade which can also speak to us.

As you can see, volume by price or the volume profile is another tool to gauge the inventory or the actual order execution that is occurring live and in the current market scenario. Here, in the middle, what we can see is instead of looking at the total volume, this is delta. Delta is the ask minus the bid. So it‚Äôll show us an overwhelming one-sided transaction. So, for instance, this negative 230 here, tells us that however many orders are transacted here, we have 230 more sell side, then we do bid side. And so this here helps us get further information out of something like a volume profile, and utilize it on an intraday basis.

Moving on, our next tool will be the footprint candle, also known as number bars. A footprint candle can be placed on any particular time frame that you wish. It maps the buy versus sell on the candle itself and shows you a picture inside the occurring auction.. Rather than just looking at a candlestick, you can actually gauge the volume that is inside of the candle, along with the Delta and see where repeating auction activity occurs. This is particularly useful to gauge structural areas or zones where there might be absorption or initiative trapped interactions within the market activity."

wallstreetbet,"Why is insider trading wrong?Why is insider trading wrong? If you are a property developer, you are not subject to scrutiny when buying property. If you work in a central bank or the import/export authority of a country, you are not exempt from foreign exchange transactions. If you work at Foxcon, you are not subject to scrutiny when buying Apple products. Why then should it be different for securities? Someone could say it's about fairness but is there a realistic duty to be to other traders? If so, how can someone be able to trade if they have access to a Bloomberg terminal or if they have more experience? Because by virtue of owing other traders fairness, it is ""unfair"" to have experience and to have access to a Bloomberg terminal. So there must he a separate reason for why insider trading is wrong? Or are the regulators just hypocritical and accept certain degrees of unfairness but not all degrees of unfairness. P.S i am pro no insider trading i personally think it unnecessarily effects analysts and even programmers at investment banks and hedge funds, I'm just wondering why it was introduced in the first place because clearly it doesn't establish a level playing field for all investors (which is what I think the law was meant to achieve)."

wallstreetbet,"There is no guaranteed recoveryEveryone in the country knows that there is a risk of a recession. Assuming a recession happens, a lot of people are talking about how the recovery will eventually happens because apparently ""markets always recover"". 

I have been watching several videos and reading a few articles about previous recessions and I do not really think a recovery is guaranteed, at least not in the next 10 years. Most economies do not recover from a crash, even though the US has recovered several times. 

Even for the United States, some crashes take more than 10 years to recover e.g. most Technology stocks took more than 10 years to recover from the dotcom crash. Stocks have three times trades lower than the previous decade in the United States.

It is true that the bubble in Japan in the 80s was bigger than the bubble in the US currently but the US economy might still suffer the same fate. The Japanese stock market has simply never recovered since the crash. The reality is that those who bought at the peak in early January or late December might walk away with losses no matter how long they wait.

My reasoning for this is as follows:

1.  What helped economic recovery in the united states previously was industrial production since US companies eventually produced things to sell. Right now, as more and more American companies produce things abroad and face stiff competition, the outcome might be very different. 
2. Americans no longer like to work as evidenced by the ""great resignation"" and increasing appetite for jobs that are basically effortless. This corresponds to what happened to the Netherlands before collapse, the French before collapse , and the British in the late 1800s. The difference is these countries simply went abroad and acquired colonial territories to do the job - an option that Americans do not have in the modern age. Even the dutch and French still had their economies collapse despite the colonial wealth.
3. There are new upcoming countries with very low costs of living leading to very low labour costs. These countries can supply the world with food and industrial goods for very cheap. This is making American producers suffer due to the high costs of living in the USA meaning high cost of labour. 
4. American politicians are not willing to take corrective measures to fix the economy out of fear of being voted out ( basically proving Socrates was right in his analogy - people always choose the sweet poison over the bitter medicine hence failure of democracy).  Corrective measures would be abolishing minimum wage and instead looking for ways to reduce cost of living by increasing production, encouraging people to save money other than spend aimlessly, deregulate the market to make it easy for new businesses, etc. No politician will ever do this because of fear of being voted out (the immediate effect will be terrible but the long term effect will be desirable). 
5. Increasing sovereign debt means the more countries find other places to buy products for cheaper, and hence the less the demand for the US Dollar, the more the American economy is in danger. Other countries are also finding alternatives in response to the US freezing Russia's foreign currency reserves.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I think these factors might make it so that the American economy finds it very difficult to undergo any kind of economic recovery after a recession. The conditions needed to recover successfully from a recession are simply not in good supply in the United States.

Anyway, this is just an opinion like any other and I would love to listen to what you guys think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR ; the economy might never recover after the crash."

Anyway, fuck that, what happens when these apes finally lock the float? The GME board obviously arent diluting (because if they did, all the apework is undone) so they clearly want to see the float locked too.

Its never been done before by my estimations, so what actually does happen? I mean, the 'apes' are locking the float slowly, and im in no doubt that they'll get it fully locked.

Will it actually trigger some sort of market moving event, or will it just be a nothingburger of hype and the goalposts get moved again?

I'm struggling to find any idea or solid examples of what actually can or cant happen when a float is locked.

Personally, I think fuck all can happen, because i remember that guy who bought every single share of some shitty pharma penny stock. Despite owning every share in the float, it continued trading in the millions of volume in the days afterwards, so I'd assume this will happen with GME too.

wallstreetbet,"Change My View: Trading stocks of a company that does not pay dividends is a zero sum gameThere's a company that sells lemonade. They are about to IPO with stock ticker = LMN. For simplicity, there are only 5 investors each with $1000. LMN will IPO with 100 shares priced at $10 each.

Conditions:
LMN shares will not pay dividend, nor will they participate in buybacks, at least for now
For this very short timespan that I'll talk about, let's just ignore inflation.

I will look specifically at the total net worth of all investors.

Here's how things play out

==========
t = -1 (pre IPO)

A = 1000, B = 1000, C = 1000, D = 1000, E = 1000, LMN = 100 shares

Total net worth of all investors = $5000

==========
t = 0 (IPO)

A, B being the savvy early investors buy the IPO. They both buy 50 shares each

A = 500 + 50 shares, B = 500 + 50 shares, C = 1000, D = 1000, E = 1000

Total net worth of all investors = $4000 + 100 shares. Share price is currently $10

==========
t = 1

Thanks to global warming, demand for lemonade goes through the roof. LMN is making a lot of money. So C, who has a PhD, does his fancy math, and concludes that LMN is very undervalued. C decides to buy 10 shares at $12, and he does so by buying them from A. 

A = 620 + 40 shares, B = 500 + 50 shares, C = 880 + 10 shares, D = 1000, E = 1000

Total net worth of all investors = $4000 + 100 shares. The share price is now $12

==========
t = 2

LMN is still making a lot of money, but misses its projected revenue numbers. B decides to sell all 50 shares at $11, so that he still ends up with a profit. Normies D and E buy 25 shares each from B, thinking they are buying the dip. 

A = 620 + 40 shares, B = 1050, C = 880 + 10 shares, D = 725 + 25 shares, E = 725 + 25 shares

Total net worth of all investors = $4000 + 100 shares. The share price is now $11

==========
t = 3

Benevolent dictator with a Jesus complex, comes to power, and decides to teach the mercenaries a lesson. He declares that stock trading and the stock market is illegal, effective now. Share price drops to 0.

A = 620 + 40 shares, B = 1050, C = 880 + 10 shares, D = 725 + 25 shares, E = 725 + 25 shares

Total net worth of all investors = $4000 + 100 shares. The share price is now $0

==========
t = 4

The mercenaries who can't live without trading stocks, decide to overthrow the dictator. They nail him to a cross. Murica is great again. They declare that the stock market is open and all shares will resume trading at last known price

A = 620 + 40 shares, B = 1050, C = 880 + 10 shares, D = 725 + 25 shares, E = 725 + 25 shares

Total net worth of all investors = $4000 + 100 shares. The share price is now back to $11

==========
t = 5

A, who was contemplating suicide at t = 3, decides to sell all his shares for $10. C, who was cool as a cucumber, sticks to his thesis that LMN is undervalued, buys the shares from A.

A = 1020, B = 1050, C = 480 + 50 shares, D = 725 + 25 shares, E = 725 + 25 shares

Total net worth of all investors = $4000 + 100 shares. The share price is now $10

and so on.......
==========


As you can see, the total net worth of all investors never changes, even though price (and hence market cap) moved wildly in both directions, and even though LMN is generating a lot of value/profit/revenue. At each step, all that happens is that money is transferred from some actors to some other actors. 


Hence, until the time company starts paying dividends, trading stocks of that company is a zero sum game i.e. your gains are somebody else's loss. It seems this is true regardless of how fast the company grows or how much the price changes. It also seems that apart from paying dividends or a liquidation event (company sale), there are no other ways of increasing investor net worth. Change my view.


NOTE 1: Instead of taking 5 people with $1000, I could have taken the entire human population and their current bank balance. The total net worth of all humans would still never change at any point. Hence, the argument that 'new investors buying into stocks adds value to the system' seems incorrect. 

NOTE 2: You could argue that LMN took that $1000 at t=0 and by t=5 had converted it into $1000 + profit. This is correct but LMN did not share any of the profit with the investors. And hence the net worth of all investors never changes.

NOTE 3: You could also argue that inflation i.e. new money creation adds value to the system. It does not, because inflation, by design, does not add any value."
wallstreetbet,"Housing Crash and Shorting the MBS ETFs To The GroundTLDR: Short or buy puts on Mortgage-Backed Securities ETFs( **Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (IVR)** and  **PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT)**). Why? Cus housing crash.

Now for the non-lazy fucks. There are countless ETFs that are out there but these 2 are the ones with the longest date on their options(2024). 

Okay so we're not blind to the bubble the Fed and Biden created to make sure the economy doesn't fall apart in 2020. This includes paying for mortgages, and lowering interest rates, hell for the past 4 years it's become easier and easier to get a house for NO MONEY DOWN or get a HELOC on your house that has close to 0% interest.

This practice has led to MBS getting filled with bullshit mortgages and BBB being ""evaluated""(just a nice way of saying buy this shit package cus the housing market cant collapse again cus it's happened twice now but housing is skyrocketing) as A or AAA(again... just like 2008). 

Now that was pre-COVID. While COVID was happening the Fed was buying MBS and lowering interest rates on new mortgages to help the economy to stay afloat cus we don't want another 2008, now do we? The banks abso-fucking-lootly loved this. They started giving out mortgages to anyone with a penny or even worse without anything. 

The repercussion was felt in February when the default rates rose by 70% from last year. Now, this June the Fed is selling 17.5 BILLION FUCKING DOLLARS in MBSs from their books alone. As months go on the QT will keep on BLEEDING these 2 ETFs to the BONES through interest hikes pushing demand down and selling MBS to say ""WE'RE DONE BAILING YOU GREEDY FUCKS FOR THIS BULL MARKET"". 

I'm thinking the market turns sour next next week and I'll be buying:

1/19/2024 IRV $1.5P

and 

1/19/2024 PMT $10P.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this information and have a nice day/night."

wallstreetbet,"Dave &amp; Buster's Calls are the Canary in the Coal Mine 

Introduction:

First and foremost friends I would like to thank you all for still sticking around and reading my due diligences. I know it has been tough these last few and I have now been horribly wrong on Zoom as well as Lululemon. While nobody can be right all or even most of the time I own up to my own incorrect positions here and I hope for those of you that took my advice that we can recoup some of those losses here and now. Additionally, as a note this is not financial advice and I am just a college student who does these on the side for fun. Anyways, enough of the bullshit and let's get to the position for this week. Dave &amp; Busters (PLAY) is the move for this week. As the most important piece of advice here, earnings is on Tuesday before market open, so if you take this ride with me we all could lose due to the implied volatility (IV) crush after earnings just as what happened with LULU unfortunately. That being said, I personally feel that the position here is naked long calls. However, the ‚Äúsafer‚Äù position may very well be a long strangle (an OTM call and put).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 1:

Earnings are coming up, on Tuesday, before market open to be exact. That being said, I expect an earnings beat as well as an optimistic forecast for the rest of the year within PLAY‚Äôs earnings call which is just as important as the earnings beat. I personally think this will be enough to cause a sharp upward move in share price that will outpace the decline in implied volatility after earnings. As a result, it will hopefully be tendies for all. I believe that earnings will shatter expectations as well as an increase in profit (forecasts) because Dave &amp; Buster‚Äôs caters to a wealthier customer base. For example, of all the arcade family fun places, Dave &amp; Buster‚Äôs is far and away the most expensive and it also caters to adults who have far more disposable income. While I am by no means a useful proxy for the entirety of PLAY‚Äôs customer base, I myself am a huge video game player and overall nerd and I enjoy frequenting Dave &amp; Buster‚Äôs, I can only imagine the money that people who are as big of nerds as myself with more disposable income spend there. Evidence for such a move includes recent earnings of other upper middle class businesses such as Victoria‚Äôs Secret and Lululemon both beating earnings and raising profit forecasts. I believe this bodes well for PLAY. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 2:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/705tyby8yi391.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2fdff6b26b97d4ee26da6ff24395be044518cd

Above is PLAY‚Äôs income statement. Upon a brief and I mean very brief, slightly Bud Light buzzed analysis, one thing in particular jumps out to me. First, total revenues as well as gross profits annually stick out to me. Both of these are of extreme importance because being literate tells us that both total revenues and gross profits exceed pre-pandemic numbers and very nearly best the 2020 pandemic numbers. The reason I see this as so incredibly bullish is because if revenues for the past year rivaled the Jerome Powell money printing era, is that not indicative of a growing, healthy business, even more so impressive in the current climate in which many consumer driven businesses are struggling. (See Walmart and Target for example) I mean good lord so many payments such as mortgage payments, student loans, and other things were all totally suspended in 2020 on top of stimulus checks and even with all of that benign conducive to booming revenues and profits for PLAY, PLAY nearly equaled that in the last annual period!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo5hoc0ayi391.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc34cbb4aaef91355875db15bad2bdf909ea88ca

Above is PLAY‚Äôs balance sheet. Examining this, I felt the confirmation bias deep in my bones for my bullish soon to be naked long calls position when looking at cash/ cash equivalents as well as net receivables. When simultaneously looking into both, I find it fascinating that cash/ cash equivalents increased in the last fiscal year to a point to where it is the largest it has been in the last 4 years while also having the second largest net receivables of the last 4 years. Logic would dictate that more net receivables would mean less cash but in this case PLAY seems to be generating both at a quicker rate than in the past. Additionally, one would expect total current liabilities and more specifically accounts payable to have increased as a result of this increase in business that drove net receivables as well as cash/ cash equivalents and yet total current liabilities only marginally increased in comparison to the growth experienced in net receivables as well as cash &amp; cash equivalents. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 3:

Attempting to place myself in the shoes of the average American consumer, I do not believe that PLAY is out of consumer‚Äôs budgets yet nor do I believe spending will have significantly decreased there yet. If other businesses that are in retail or food industries have not caved yet to the macroeconomic pressures facing the US markets, then I believe that PLAY will not either and as a result will have a solid quarter. I do not believe PLAY is sound long term or even past the date of a short term options position to be honest, however, I certainly believe this could be the last gasp for a US economy before we enter a recession. While some would argue that PLAY will suffer just as Walmart and Target did, I would counter with stronger than expected earnings from Costco, Macy‚Äôs, and Nordstrom. I see these companies not as comparables to PLAY, however I do believe they have a similar customer base in middle class/ upper middle class Americans. Upper middle class Americans have weathered the inflation and supply chain shitstorm that has been bestowed upon the United States. As a result, PLAY will do well. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Where I could be wrong:

1. The house of cards has begun to fall, starting with a slowdown in consumer spending within the middle class/ upper middle class markets, obliterating PLAY revenues. 
2. IV crush. This is the most important right. I, or you for that matter could be correct but if the underlying stock price does not move enough to offset the lessening of IV after earnings, all parties are fucked, bulls, bears, it does not matter. 
3. I am wrong about PLAY‚Äôs demographic. If PLAY‚Äôs demographic is not a predominantly middle class or preferably upper middle class base, I am fucked. Their earnings will do a Walmart and Target but part 3 and quite possibly more disastrous in terms of the destruction to our call premiums.
4. Neither happens, no move up, no move down. In this case a strangle would suffer the most as a result of the additional premiums paid banking on a large movement in the stock price. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Closing Remarks:

Fellow apes please do grill me in the comment section of this post before market open Monday. As you all know, I do my DDs and then open a position the following day (usually Monday) so if I am missing something let me know. My head is an echochamber in which the last two brain cells that escaped the glue I sniffed constantly bang around coming up with shit like these options positions. Lastly, I appreciate you all more than you know, anyone who views, upvotes, comments, or direct messages me means the absolute world to me. Although I am on a losing streak the last few positions I have quite a bit of fun doing this and if you would like to see more feel free to view my last posts and/ or follow me as I do a DD every week and if not each week it is at least biweekly. Have a good night friends, and happy soon to be tendies! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Dave &amp; Buster‚Äôs is going to crush earnings expectations and give an increased profit forecast going forward as their wealthier demographic continues to spend in their food and arcade business. Additionally, the financials are indicative of earnings being fantastic before market open Tuesday. Therefore, buy calls, make tendies, or if that puckers your asshole too much, open a strangle so when this shit bounces around more than a Boeing 737 that was never properly inspected, you can make money.

wallstreetbet,"WSB Chief Senior Blanalyst Market Review of the Day&amp;#x200B;

***Friday September 16, 20 Fucking 22***. Last night, FedEx's CEO had some very choice words to say about the economy after his company cut a third off of their EPS estimate from $5.14 to $3.44. Keep in mind, this is the absolute worst delivery company on the market, with the highest lost package rate, AND longest average delivery times. But here‚Äôs what big boy Subramaniam had to say,

‚Äú MY COMPANY DOESN‚ÄôT SUCK THE ECONOMY IS JUST ABOUT TO HIT THE WORST EVER RECESSION DUDE! IF MY COMPANY ISN'T DOING GOOD IMAGINE HOW BAD APPLE‚ÄôS DOING!‚Äù 

That‚Äôs what he said and I quote. Fax. Anyway for whatever reason Wall Street seems to agree with  Subramaniam and the market (SPY and QQQ) opened lower and fell to -X on the day. For the first few hours finance and energy fell the hardest. OH I FORGOT BOIS MICH SENTIMENT CAME OUT THIS MORNING!

So, our consensus was 60 and we came in just short at 59.5 which is slightly bullish for stocks but our previous MCSI was 58.5. So technically sentiment is higher than last month but barely, and technically we were lower than consensus‚Ä¶It evens out but be aware we aren't dropping sentiment like we would hope. Back to the markets. 

While finance and energy so far are today‚Äôs biggest losers (Sal and Joe) sitting at an averaged -3.5%, retail and automakers are barely down an averaged -0.5%. Amazon however, on the ‚Äútech‚Äù side of retail was down 3.5% by 7:30 (10:30 for you east coasties). Other company‚Äôs I like that are down today trading  are: 

* $SQ (Block Inc.) ***-4.5%***
* $GE (General Electric) ***-3.5%***
* $SOFI (SoFi Technologies) ***-4.5%***
* $BA (Boeing) ***-4.5%***
* $SNAP (Snapchat) ***-5%***
* $COP (ConocoPhillips) ***-2%***
* $ADBE (Adobe) ***4.5%***

I was pretty convinced after Fed Ex‚Äôs comments and seeing Michigan go up that we were going to see a red day today. Not rebalancing anything, just taking the dips to the chin and rolling with the punches. This next week with Daddy Powell speaking we  should, if nothing else, get some volatility to trade, but honestly with 75-100 basis points looming on the horizon all I can say is buckle up bois. IT'S GON‚Äô GET BUMPY! Oh yeah, I spent my last couple checks on SoFi calls. SoFi to $20 EoY!!!! What y'all trading into the end of the year?"

Following the discovery of a breach in Uber's network on Thursday, the company took several of its internal engineering and communications systems offline to investigate.

Cybersecurity researchers and The New York Times received images of Uber's email, cloud storage, and code repositories following the hack.

According to Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs who corresponded with the person claiming responsibility for the breach, they have full access to Uber. ‚ÄúThis is a total compromise, from what it looks like.‚Äù

According to Uber's spokesperson, the company is investigating the data breach and contacting authorities. There were inaccessible other internal systems at Uber, according to two employees without authorization to speak publicly. Employees had been instructed not to use the company's internal messaging service, Slack.

A message was sent to Uber employees shortly before the Slack system was taken offline on Thursday afternoon stating, ‚ÄúI announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach.‚Äù The message went on to list several internal databases that the hacker claimed had been compromised.

Hackers compromised a worker's Slack account and sent the message through it, Uber said. The hacker later uploaded an explicit photo to an internal employee information page, which appears to indicate he gained access to other internal systems.

As reported by the New York Times, the hacker sent a text message pretending to be an information technology employee to an Uber employee. Hackers used social engineering to persuade workers to hand over passwords, allowing them to access Uber's systems.

According to the hacker, he is 18 years old and had worked on his cybersecurity skills for several years before he demonstrated his access to Uber's internal systems. According to him, Uber's systems were weakly secured, so he was able to break into them. As part of the announcement of the breach, the person also called for Uber drivers to be paid more.

An Uber source code, email, and other internal systems appeared to be accessible to the person."

# Why is this gobbledygook relevant?

The Federal Reserve creates money and uses it to buy bonds. They do this to push interest rates down and to put more money into the economy. Low rates mean people can borrow more, spend more, and afford higher prices. More spending and higher prices mean people feel rich, and businesses hire new employees.

But, if prices rise too quickly or people borrow too much, the Fed does the opposite. It sells the bonds it has and then destroys the money it receives. These sales push interest rates up and take money out of the economy. Higher rates mean people can't borrow or spend as much and must pay lower prices. It makes people feel poorer than before, stops them from being able to spend as much, and makes businesses trim employment.

In addition to this, the Fed borrows and lends to banks. If a bank doesn't have enough money for a day or two, it can borrow from the Fed. If it has too much, it can lend to the Fed. A group of people who work for the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decide the interest rate that the Fed will pay for, or demand of, these short-term loans.

The Fed does these because they believe in two objectives: first, a low and stable inflation rate is good for the economy, and second, that minimising unemployment is desirable.

# FAQs

W**hy do you look at weekly average balance sheet data instead of the Wednesday level?**

It takes time for asset settlement to occur. The holdings on any given day will fluctuate wildly‚Äîespecially given that the Fed owns almost $9trn of assets. The weekly average is smoother and more indicative of the monetary policy trend.

‚ÄúI think so. But you know, these numbers, they don‚Äôt portend very well,‚Äù Subramaniam said in response to Cramer‚Äôs question of whether the economy is ‚Äúgoing into a worldwide recession.‚Äù

The CEO‚Äôs pessimism came after FedEx missed estimates on revenue and earnings in its first quarter. The company also withdrew its full year guidance.

Shares of FedEx fell 15% in extended trading on Thursday.

The chief executive, who assumed the position earlier this year, said that weakening global shipment volumes drove FedEx‚Äôs disappointing results. While the company anticipated demand to increase after factories shuttered in China due to Covid opened back up, it actually fell, he said.

wallstreetbet,"The World May Be Edging Toward A Global Recession As Central Banks Across The World Simultaneously Hike Interest Rates, The World Bank Warned.The world may be edging toward a global recession as central banks simultaneously raise interest rates to combat persistent inflation, the World Bank has warned.

The three largest economies, ‚Äì the US, China and the eurozone ‚Äì have been slowing sharply, and even a ‚Äúmoderate hit to the global economy over the next year could tip it into recession‚Äù, the bank said in a study.

It said the global economy was now in its steepest slowdown after a post-recession recovery since 1970, and consumer confidence had already dropped more sharply than in the run-up to previous global recessions.

‚ÄúGlobal growth is slowing sharply, with further slowing likely as more countries fall into recession,‚Äù the World Bank president, David Malpass, said, adding his worry that these trends would persist, with devastating consequences for emerging market and developing economies.

Synchronised interest rate increases under way globally and related policy actions were likely to continue well into next year but may not be sufficient to bring inflation back down to levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic, the bank said.

Unless supply disruptions and labour-market pressures subsided, the global core inflation rate, excluding energy, could stay at about 5% in 2023, almost double the five-year average before the pandemic.

To drive inflation lower, central banks may need to raise interest rates by an additional two percentage points, on top of the two-percentage point increase already seen over the 2021 average, it said.

However, an increase of that size, along with financial market stress, would slow global gross domestic product growth to 0.5% in 2023, or a 0.4% contraction in per capita terms, which would meet the technical definition of a global recession, it added.

Full article: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/16/world-bank-warns-higher-interest-rates-could-trigger-global-recession](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/16/world-bank-warns-higher-interest-rates-could-trigger-global-recession)

The same thing happened back in Jan for our first major drop of $470 to $420

Then again on March where we went from $460 to $385

Real target would actually be $325 looking at market structure and comparing the recent drops from high trend touches

Now, if we assume that option sellers (usually market makers) will be delta hedging \[[small explainer](https://twitter.com/bennpeifert/status/1306690675245678592?lang=ar), from Benn Eifert a legit quant\] to avoid taking a position on the underlying stock, we *could* see them purchasing 100 shares for every call that comes ITM. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential play from MM hedging**

I know that this is something rare to see, but we did see it in April 2022 with System1, September 2021 with IronNet, June 2021 with AMC, and January 2021 with GameStop. Still, the results are fucking wild when it happens.

At $15, we have \~1000 calls ITM (potentially 100k shares worth of delta hedging, or 20% of free float), at $20 another 1000 ($15-$20), at $25, another 3000. Just over 500k shares worth of potential hedging by MMs, greater than current free float. Past 25 it gets real nuts. 

&amp;#x200B;

|Price|Calls ITM|Shares to hedge by MMs |% of FF (508,311 shares)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|15|934|93,400|18.4%|
|20|1,944|194,400|38.2%|
|25|5,288|528,800|104%|
|30|9,206|920,600|181.1%|
|35|12,203|1,220,300|240.1%|
|40|14,383|1,438,300|283%|
|55|18,540|1,854,000|364.7%|

 

**Sky high SI, CTB, max pain at $25**

Short interest is also high, at 108% of the FF \[[SI #](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gety?mod=md_funds_majorHoldings), Barron's, 8/31 numbers\]. CTB was over 800% last I checked, see old DD. Max pain (where option sellers can burn most calls), is currently $25, MMs have incentive to move price there and it easier to do that on a low float.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Maybe it runs, microfloat as confirmed by CFO. High SI, high CTB, worth a lotto.

&amp;#x200B;

**My position:**

15c and 20c for Sep 16 expiry."

I expect some pullback then sell if price rolls back to it. My goal is the support level at 1640.000.

wallstreetbet,"Weird Finance 3.0: TMUS is most valuable telco worldwide and DTAG is on track to get a 100b$ market valuation... but where is the negative value coming from?...[T-Mobile's market cap was $183.68 billion compared with Verizon's market cap of $183.40 billion, as of 1:46 p.m. ET](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-08-25-2022/card/t-mobile-market-value-surpasses-verizon-R1GTJMqs48VxbJWMvBsJ)

Given the ambition to grow DTAG to a 100bn‚Ç¨ marcap company - that's good news. But there is this thing:  
\- DTAG owns around 48.4% of TMUS, or 88,8b$  
\- that leaves non-US part of DTAG valued at around 6bn‚Ç¨  
\- That includes the segments Germany, Europe, and T-Systems and some minor staff

now take this: Germany alone (!) made 9bn‚Ç¨ EBITDA last year. Even if we discard T-Systems and Europe that is a 0.6 EBITDA multiple - which is nonsense  
Fair value for Germany at (lets assume) 6 multiples would be 45bn‚Ç¨.

**So 39bn‚Ç¨ negative valuation must be attributed to Europe+T-Systems**

Any thoughts?"

wallstreetbet,"Don't bet against the Mouse - DIS DDThesis: Disney + / Vaccines / Reopening / Rising Prices

Disney + has taken Netflix's market share. There is a set market for video streaming and with Netflix's numbers coming out we saw they are not gaining as many users as before, my thesis is that Dis+ took most of it with better kid friendly content. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11f5bxylc0


We saw what Snap did when Facebook reported they were losing marketshare, I am adopting the same thesis to Disney taking Netflix marketshare. Not to mention Encanto being one of Disneys biggest movies this quarter - https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=encanto


On Vaccines we know that more and more people are vaccinated and with both theme parks open we should see more and more people heading to parks. With JnJ reporting massive vaccine sales we should see MRNA and PFE also report the same which just means more people are vaccinated. This ties into https://allears.net/2022/01/24/we-werent-ready-for-the-crowds-in-disney-world-today/ the huge number of people just visiting all the parks.


Genie+ / Fast pass - https://touringplans.com/blog/how-to-use-disney-genie-and-lightning-lane-at-disneyland/ - Disneyland pretty much said fuck it lets charge park goers an extra $30-$50 for the same experience to save time. 


Technicals - We already saw a huge drop in DIS - https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmMP0itP/ trading at 2019 Pre Pandemic levels which is in par with the similar drops we've seen on major tech companies, so the drop is already in, with more R:R on the upside.

wallstreetbet,"Elon Musk and The CCP Won't Mix Long TermAlright retards, I know the T word is very sensitive around here. But, I'm just gonna bust in like the kool-aid man of üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêªs.

You and me both know that Musky is an absolute loose cannon when he sits on the toilet with his phone. One could literally imagine anything under the sun breaking securities laws, telling a sitting U.S. Senator he looks like he came, and criticizing the government heavily. However, it is interesting to note that Musk hardly ever mentions China in almost any negative light. It's almost as if a majority of his production relies on the whims of an image obsessed regime. 

It is well known that to gain access to the profit laden Chinese market you sacrifice your first born sons left nut and every ounce of intellectual property. The intellectual property that isn't handed over willingly is probably just stolen too. Now there is one thing that China loves more then stealing other peoples intellectual property, and that is creating near knockoffs with that intellectual property. 

I mean look at what happened to Jack Ma, he mentions the whip of reform then just falls off the side of the map, when questioned the CCP told you he went away on a vacation lol. By happenstance, if Musk unleashes those twitter fingers on anything and I mean anything that remotely offends Xi or the CCP it could ignite hell. If Tesla even has a chance to sell 118% of the cars on the planet, the Chinese market is going to be key.

\-Complete speculation, but in my üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª wet dream I foresee a reality where Musk grows huge balls and makes a Winnie the Pooh and Xi reference just for the memes

Just like everything in China, the promise of massive short term profit increase is guranteed, but sets an ominous long term tone."

wallstreetbet,"I'm predicting a huge miss on Peloton earnings tomorrow. Here's why...Everything going on with Peloton recently is suspicious. They released preliminary quarterly results on January 20th via their investor relation page which only gave us a peek into their coming up short on expectations. The stock tanked 25% subsequently. 

Then we conviently get rumors about a possible acquisition after their preliminary report and the stock reclaimed the initial 25% drop. 

What this tells me is that their earnings are going to be horrible and they wanted to mitigate the blow the full earnings report will have on their stock price by having the price hit come in two waves with a pump in-between based on nothing but a maybe. We're witnessing some serious grasping and manipulation from a dying company trying to stay afloat. 

I predict we're going to see Peloton tank hard tomorrow on earnings after market close from not only a huge miss on EPS/revenue and declining subscriptions, but also from no further concrete acquisition news considering no savy suitors would buy an unprofitable company at their current overbloated valuation. 

What are your thoughts?

&gt; SoftBank will receive a break-up fee of up to $1.25 billion and is seeking to unload Arm through an initial public offering before the end of the year, said one of the people.

&gt; The failure is set to result in a management upheaval at Arm, with chief executive Simon Segars being replaced by Rene Haas, head of the company‚Äôs intellectual property unit, the person added.

&gt; However, people close to SoftBank said the group prefers the idea of listing Arm in New York and will seek to resist nationalistic pressure. US markets accord higher valuations to tech stocks, even after a recent sharp reversal, and UK tech executives recently pressed for changes to listing arrangements to make London more attractive.

wallstreetbet,"If You Cannot Beat Them, Join Them - Congress Trading &amp; Retail TradersJust wrote a blog post and thought it's worth sharing here to let retail know what's going on.

2021 was a great year for the market as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  rallied about 25%, which is significantly more than its average yearly  return. Many traders made money, but there was one group that made more  than most of us, and that was the group of US politicians. In 2012, the [STOCK ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)  was introduced to prevent the members of congress from using any  insider information to make trades, and require them to report their  trades within 45 days.

We are not sure how much is the rule followed these days by the members  of congress, but what we have seen over the last few years is how well  members of congress have been doing [extremely well](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/)  in terms of their performance in the markets. This could either be just  a coincidence, or they have more information than an average Joe.  Whatever the case is, the purpose of this post is to help retail traders  follow the congress trades to also earn profits like them. 

## Congress Trades 

Since the STOCK ACT requires the members of congress to report their  trades within 45 days, we want to find a way we can  leverage those trades to find some edge in the markets. As soon as a new  trade by one of the members of congress is reported, we publish it in our [Congress Market Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-market) shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/6h8rtk99wig81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e51c5f81c661c86a30c88466de8495d93de2d06

This is every single trade that gets reported - one way we can think  about leveraging them is by simply taking the same trade. However, there  are a couple of issues there. First, not all members of the congress  outperform the market indices every year, only a few do. Second, these  trades are delayed by upto 45 days. Sometimes, the stock might have  already made a big move when they are reported, we want to be careful of  that. Finally, different amounts of money are spent on these trades,  and we want to weight them accordingly. The screenshot below shows the  top trades made by congressmen and women - millions of dollars going  into a trade should signify that these people are very confident in  their trades, and we should be okay in following them. Keeping these  limitations in mind, we try to solve them and end up with a solution.

Looking at the historical data, we came up with a few observations.  First, many congress trades have a long time period i.e congressmen and  women do not enter into trades and exit immediately. This fixes the  issue of the 45 day delay although it does impact us somewhat in case  the stock has already made a big move before the report. Second, there  are many smaller trades and it is hard to use them well. When  significant money is being put into a trade, we want to weigh it more,  as it provides us more confidence. Finally, we want to be able to update  our picks as new data comes in. Based on these three observations, we  developed what we call a [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf) that combines congress trades in an intelligent manner and outperforms SPY.

At every day, the congress ETF takes the top 100 trades based on  their value and assigns them weights proportional to the amount that  went into the trade. The weights of the symbols are considered their  allocation, and it changes every day as new trades come in. Sold  positions are automatically removed from the ETF once they are reported.  Based on this dynamic allocation of symbols, we construct an ETF called  Congress ETF. Before diving into more details, let us first take a look  at the performance of the ETF and compare it to SPY.

https://preview.redd.it/q5wuo8tbwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3bf4d88e81dd63240369cb6745e87b17c50934

Looking at the chart above, we can see that the Congress ETF outperforms [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) by a factor of 2, which means it's twice as good as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY). If you've traded for a while, you would know that beating the markets i.e [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  is not an easy job, especially on a consistent basis. Now that we've  seen the performance, the question you as readers would have is how can  you actually use the ETF to earn money.

### How do I follow Congress ETF? 

In our [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf),  we keep a chart that shows the allocation of each symbol in the  portfolio. All trades are long trades, and the chart on average updates  every 1-2 weeks, since not many large trades are frequently made by the  congressmen and women. For instance, an example allocation could be MSFT  (40%) and AAPL (60%) which would mean if you have a 1000 dollars, you  should buy shares worth 400 dollars for Microsoft and worth 600 for  Apple. The chart below shows the allocation of symbols over time. There  are about 47 symbols in the ETF right now, but if that is a large number  for you, you can also pick up the top 10 symbols based on their bar  size in the chart

https://preview.redd.it/qxvoro4dwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2efc1622e322d365ca220f5d51c487f92bf189ab

If you look at the allocation chart, you can see how each new bar  comes after a week or two. That's because very large trades are rarely  made by politicians's, but whenever they are, we pick them right away,  and readjust the ETF. In future, we might automate and allow you to  simply do one click and put a fixed amount of money in the entire ETF.  But right now, the process is somewhat tedious and manual.

## Congressmen &amp; Women ETF 

As we discussed, the Congress ETF at the time of writing this  contains about 47 symbols, which can sometimes be too much to follow for  a retail user. In order to fix that, we also allow users to analyze  individual congressmen and women's portfolios. We employ a similar  process as described earlier on the construct the ETF, but on average,  there are at most 5-10 names in every politician's portfolio, making it  easy for retail traders to follow. But which members of the congress  should we follow? That's a good question and needs answering first.

https://preview.redd.it/e8qgcn9ewig81.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f58a30d311f644be9b130c4fc13651cec7ad17

The chart above shows the average performance of each traded taken by  the best performing congressmen and women. If you've read the news  lately, it is no surprise to see the great Nancy Pelosi in there,  because she did quite well [last year](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/).  These are the people that we want to follow. Now let us take a look at  Nancy's portfolio and see how easy it is at Tradytics to follow her  trades.

### Nancy Pelosi ETF 

In order to get the dashboard for individual members of congress, you can head over to our [Individual Congress Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual).  The default search is already for Nancy Pelosi, so we will dive right  into her portfolio. The figure below shows her ETF performance, symbol  allocation, and the times when readjustments were made to the portfolio.

https://preview.redd.it/1z9bs9ifwig81.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995e3c0b2f430147f6dbae3212e4f0834dffc6b6

Looking at the screenshot above, the first thing to note is that  although the congress ETF beat SPY by about 2x, the Nancy ETF actually  beat it by 2.6x which shows how good she has been trading lately. The  more important graph is the lower one that shows the allocation of each  symbol in her portfolio at every day the readjustments were made. In  contrast to the congress ETF, there are only about 10-11 symbols in her  portfolio and she only made new trades about a dozen times in the last  year, which is very manageable for retail traders as well. It is easy  for us to keep an eye on her positions in the [dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual) and follow them whenever they are reported.

## Limitations &amp; Final Thoughts 

Most people believe that the 45 day delay in reporting causes some  limitations in trying to follow congress trades. As discussed earlier,  that is obviously true to some extent but retail traders can still  follow positions even after that delay, and still be able to earn  similar profits as the members of congress. If you go ahead and take a  look at the trades tables in the dashboards, you will actually see that  many of the positions had not moved much before they were reported to  the public. That is also a criteria that you can use to follow trades -  only go into the ones that haven't moved much at the time of reporting.  Despite some of the limitations, we believe Congress trading is a good  source of generating alpha in the markets and can help retail traders  find an edge. As always, please always do your due diligence before  going into a trade, stay safe, and manage risk. Thank you for reading."

For anyone unfamiliar, they have a glucose monitoring system that only needs to be replaced every 180 days instead of the industry standard 30. All their trial data looks great, and they've been waiting on the FDA to greenlight the system, and they keep pushing off the approval due to being backlogged with Covid. 

They issued solid guidance recently and made a statement that approval was ""imminent"" in the coming weeks. I timed my entry poorly a few days before Omicron news hit and have been bagholding since November but it's really been taking off the past few days and I'm solidly green now. I'm wondering if it's starting to get priced in for the approval. 

I'm thinking this is an easy 3x bagger if you got in around 2-$2.20 or so and at this point there's still a solid potential for 50% or maybe even 100% after approval hits.

Key Points
Biotech stocks have been some of the worst-performing equities over the past four months.
Shares of Gritsone bio and Sorrento Therapeutics could sharply rebound later on this year.
Motley Fool Issues Rare ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Buy Alert

Biotech stocks are going through a historic drawdown at the moment. Nearly 400 publicly traded biotech companies have lost 40% or more of their value in just the past six months. The market's irrational behavior toward all things biotech, however, isn't necessarily a bad thing for patient investors. Many of these beaten-down biotech stocks will ultimately rebound.

Which unloved biotech stocks are the most compelling buys amid this industrywide downturn? While there are scores of intriguing bargains in biotech right now, Gritstone bio (NASDAQ:GRTS) and Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE) both have the potential to deliver life-changing gains for risk-tolerant investors. Here is a brief overview on the key value drivers associated with each stock.

Doctor fanning out money.
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Gritstone bio: A hidden gem
Gritstone's shares are down by almost 70%, relative to their 52-week high, at the time of this writing. This is one falling knife that investors might want to catch, however.

Despite the market's dour take on this clinical-stage immunotherapy company, Wall Street has remained steadfast in terms of its uber-positive outlook toward Gritstone. The average analyst price target on this stock, after all, implies a whopping 276% upside potential from current levels. 

What's behind Wall Street's super bullish outlook? One big reason for this glowing optimism is Gritstone's next-generation messenger RNA (mRNA) tech. This tech, known as self-amplifying mRNA, has the potential to substantially boost the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines across a wide swath of indications. Gritstone hopes that its cutting-edge mRNA platform will ultimately lead to novel therapies for a variety of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and HIV, as well as a host of cancers. 

What's the next big catalyst? While Gritstone's COVID vaccine work has garnered a fair amount of attention, the biotech's clinical program for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer might be its crown jewel. Patients with this malignancy have few effective treatment options. Gritstone, as a result, could deliver a truly meaningful advancement in this space with its personalized RNA therapy known as Granite. The biotech is slated to update investors on its lead oncology program later this year; any positive developments on this front should be a healthy catalyst for Gritstone's shares.   

Sorrento Therapeutics: A galaxy's worth of value drivers
Shares of Sorrento Therapeutics are presently down by a jaw-dropping 80% from their 52-week high. Wall Street, though, thinks this beaten-down biotech stock could rise as much as 596% over the next 12 months.  

What's behind Wall Street's bullish forecast? A few things. First up, Sorrento is on the cusp of building out a robust product franchise for COVID. Keeping with this theme, the biotech already has an Emergency Use Authorization for its Covistix test in Mexico. This high-value franchise ought to net multiple additional product approvals over the course of 2022. 

Next up, Sorrento's pipeline now harbors a potential franchise-level drug with its recently acquired immunotherapy abivertinib. The highlight here is that the drug posted exceptionally strong efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, an indication that could garner blockbuster-level sales within a few short years. What's more, Sorrento is gearing up for trials of abivertinib in a broad range of high-dollar indications such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, prostate cancer, and graft-versus-host disease. Abivertinib, in turn, might eventually morph into a mega-blockbuster drug (greater than $5 billion in annual sales).

All things considered, Sorrento's hefty downturn doesn't appear to be warranted. Bargain hunters, therefore, might want to capitalize on the stock's recent weakness.       [Montley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/07/2-beaten-down-biotech-stocks-that-could-make-you-f/)"

1: it is the company that supports/distributes the OS the 99% of the internet runs on: Ubuntu server Linux.

2: current pushback from windows 11 and it requiring hardware locked out devices. Would drive them more desktop support as people upgrade from windows 10 to an alternative working OS.

3: steamdeck is the shit: and just works - exposing people to Linux: with the previous two points as given their likely first point of contact to actual support is‚Ä¶ canonical.

4: this ipo when it hits will be undervalued, considering FOSS is ‚Äògenerally‚Äô considered unprofitable. (Canonical can afford engineers at fang salary level). Their main service is support: which ape brain may need with fancy computer box.

5: they are the people servicing fang and all internet related, at an operating system/networking level.

This might be akin to just pounding on a koopa troopa in SMB for infinite lives only this is with dividends. I figure this could be feasible with most online brokers having $0 commission on stock trades and if you do this in a Roth IRA to avoid the tax man. So here are the steps:

1- Have a list of all the stocks with ex-dividend dates coming up

2- Day before the ex-dividend buy the largest yielder. You are recorded as a holder by the company at the close of this day

3- Next day sell stock A and buy stock B (as long as stock B is a day before the ex-dividend date)

4- Rinse and repeat for eternity

In theory this would just arbitrage dividends tax free and commission free (as long as you stick to common stocks; do not mess around with certain REITs or BDCs which dividends could even be taxable in a Roth) and losses/gains on the actually trade should actually be close to zero if not a gain (since long term stonks only go up). 

If you do this for multiple stocks daily then eventually you should be getting daily dividends credited to your account in cash then you can use that cash to buy more shares or companies each day for the dividends and after doing this for decades it would have a super charge effect like DRIPs only for your entire portfolio instead of certain positions which you would have to wait months for to get.

The con is this would just be for a long term retirement strategy only."

500 Spy C 02/11. This is a call. A call means you call bullshit on a stock and think it will crash. Use this if you think A stock is overvalued or will crash soon. 02/11 is the expiration date meaning this is how long you have to hold and make money. The closer it gets to the date the more money you can make.

400 Spy P 02/11. This is a put. Think about it as putting your money where your mouth is. If you are putting faith in a company going up you buy puts to the price you think they're going up to. The easiest way to remember this is P= Profits. Buy them when stocks are going to go up. The same expiration date information applies to puts.

DD = Don't Do it. This where users argue against what they believe is going to happen to strengthen their arguments. Anything you read in a dd should be taken as false it is strictly a thought experiment.

IV = Instant Value. The higher the IV the more likely your position is to make money. The higher the IV the cheaper options are. This is when you want to buy them.

FD = Free Dollars. Buying FDs is basically like printing money because the expiration date is so soon that you're able to make money much faster.

CPI = Cock Penis Integration. This data comes out this Thursday signifying how much bears are going to take it in their ass for the given month."

Rite Aid stock (RAD) has all the ingredients for a GME style runner. RAD has $24 Billion RAD makes $476 million in Free Cash Flow.

RAD now has only 54 million RAD shares outstanding. With 15 million shares shorted. It wouldn't take much to trigger squeeze. Now my whole point to this comparison is to say. This discussion isn't all about how it's no way Shorts can cover RAD without a major spike. This about the Rite  Aid Yahoo  message board. Any positive comments seem to get removed or deleted.

wallstreetbet,"SPY 2/7 The chop festWell this will probably be a shorter post because honestly not a whole lot happened today.... 

Today was the definition of flat/ sideways... my guess is the markets are not quite sure how to price in CPI data which drops thursday the 10th. POWELL said inflation is worse than we thought, however, CNBC was saying itll be 5% instead of 7%. Truly no one knows. However we did finish red and we do have a few things to continue to watch through the week. 

We are currently trading a symmetrical triangle (white solid lines) within a symmetrical triangle (red and blue dotted). 
https://i.imgur.com/BlZU8X9.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/sstIqGF.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/JHDhmnf.jpeg


As you can see we bounced between the white solid lined all day. And potentially we could see the same thing tomorrow 

Supports to watch- 446 (support of white triangle) --&gt; 443.5 (fridays low) --&gt; 439 (100 ema) --&gt; 436 (red dotted support line).

Resistance to watch- 448 (daily 5 ema) --&gt; 450 (resistance of white triangle) --&gt; 453.5 (daily 100 ema) --&gt; 455 (blue dotted resistance line/ daily 50 ema)

Overall like i said today was super flat and really unexciting. We dont really have any big catalysts to propel us upwards or send us spiraling downward until thursday when CPI drops in the morning (pretty sure its 8am). 

10% Options Challenge- 
Google- ""reddit daddyd 10% option challenge"" should be first one.

-Today i was unable to trade unfortunately. I am making a switch from fidelity to think or swim due to issues with fidelity freezing and not allowing me to close my positons. I have moved my funds over to TOS but unfortunately to start trading options cash only they need the bank transfer to fully settle first. So i hope to be back trading thursday at the latest. 
- quite a few of you reached out today and shared their 5-10% wins for the day! Congrats guys on the first day of small gains beating yolo gains. 
- a couple reminders here... 
1. There may be days like today where there isnt a clear direction or a clear run that SPY is going on. If its flat and you dont think confidently you can make a 10% options trade. Sit the day out.
2. Some have mentioned they made 2 or 3 10% trades back to back today. Thats fine and nothing wrong with that. But dont get greedy by over trading. You can force a trade when you dont need to and be just as greedy as if you had just held the first
3. This challenge isnt for everyone and clearly some people dont understand what its all about. Everyone has a different risk tolerance. And everyone needs to do whats right for them and their families. Some may only be able to do 5% some 10% some 20%. 
4. I made it clear we never let the trade go red. But let me clarify that as there is some confusion. When you first enter you may initially be red momentarily. Its only to be down 5-10% for a few minutes. We may not always as much as we want to catch straight green. But what i meant by this is we never let a trade thats up 10, 20 or 30% finish red because we got so greedy and it turned fast on us. It happens unfortunately that we are right and made a great trade but there is an unexpected reversal. Have a stop loss. 
5. I mentioned a break even stop loss is better than red. Some didnt understand that. Yes being up 10% you probably should take profits and walk away. But if you really think its gonna go your way and really think its going to run. Set a breakeven stop loss and let it go. Of course if you were right and you get 15-20% up move that stop loss to 10%. This eliminates red days. 
6. This is a completely different approach than most people take which is why its getting so much flak. Most people who do options are 100% gambling. They see SPY had a red day and say yes man 10% OTM calls for tomorrow 0 dte for sure. Thats gambling not investing. We dont yolo. We make an informed and calculated move. 

Again once i finally have settled funds i will include my entry and exit with what % i closed at everyday."

wallstreetbet,"TRYING TO REACH THE GOAL read Hi guys, my name is Jack and I've been active here on reddit for a while, mostly I'm promoting my nfts and what motivates me the most is the financial part, because I'm in dire need of money.  I know that people with money solve everyday problems and that there is a problem in fact I am here in an attempt to make a sale or get it. What motivated me to go to this digital world was an infiltration that took place in my house and the repair cost around 12K-15k reais, which is a little over U$ 2.3K.  I live in Brazil and my English is not good at all, so there may be errors in this text. I'm making money in different ways whenever a new difficulty comes up, late rent, my sister's medicine, food and other bills.  I'm a university with 100% scholarship, so I can't work formally because if the income increases, college cuts my scholarship. That's why I try to write some articles for a company on the internet that works with AdSense, they pay me in reais, which in dollars is about U$3-4 per day. It helps a lot, but it's not enough to solve infiltration problems or change your life.  I'm trying to live with the problems and solve them very well, because my mom has been through the whole thing and I want to know what she's waiting for, but I have to take a turn on my mom and make her proud.  What I'm going is not alms I ask you to give a piece, in my arts on OpenSea and if you are interested buy it. In case you need a video editor, I can edit in Sony Vegas and I can also learn anything related to the internet and the computer.  I will leave a link to collaborations and my collection on OpenSea, as well as my profile on Instagram and Twitter, in addition to the photos of the infiltration. I really hope someone at least reads this.

- Pre-Tax income down 68%

wallstreetbet,"Puts now, handys later? Affirm earnings 2/10Just got an email from Citi card offering BNPL with Amazon (6.73% APR, payment plans from 3 to 48 months depending on the purchase amount).  This got me thinking about AFRM again.

I held AFRM last year and was saved by the Amazon partnership announcement (sold immediately after, which was too soon, still had PTSD from RKT bags).  Growth stocks have largely been profits or bust this year, so even though AFRM has taken a huge dump, I'm guessing there's more pain to come.  Here's my shitty DD:

-Last September, Credit Carma reported 35% of BNPL customers were late on one or more payments.  Last earnings from AFRM said they had about 5% delinquency.  My guess is the delinquency rate has risen.

-The Amazon partnership probably won't be as great as assumed.  Amazon earnings were ok, but the $20 rise in Prime membership made AMZN pump.  AFRM surely gained revenue, but lately the market doesn't care about revenue increases.  

-Stimmies ran out Q4 last year.  Possibly more revenue for AFRM, but also more delinquencies.

-P/S still high at around 16.5

-Statista says about 55% of Amazon Prime subscribers make more than 75k a year.  BNPL is mostly geared toward lower income buyers with no credit cards.  On top, Amazon has offered payment plans itself for some time.  Maybe the partnership wasn't that valuable.

On the flip side AFRM could post a profit, absolutely crush revenue, or announce they're being bought out by AMZN.  Here's to hoping I can beat the IV crush.  If not, maybe Russia invades Ukraine or some shit.

wallstreetbet,"Little noticed: DWAC up 90% since 1 January 2022Since all kinds of media stocks have been crowding the headlines (FB/Meta), it's noteworthy that an interesting little SPAC seems to have nearly doubled since the beginning of the year.

DWAC has gone from US$53 on 7 January to US$95 today.  No headlines in the MSM media, or WSJ, or Barrons, or FT... most curious.

Now, this SPAC has political implications - it's a vehicle to take former President Donald Trump's Media  and Technology's ""Truth Social"" platform public.

Doesn't matter whether you're a Trump supporter or a Trump hater, it's an indication that the so-called MSM is vulnerable to market erosion from otherwise ""new and alternative"" news and media distribution platforms.  Example:  CNN's audience is down 90% from its peak a few years ago.

Motley Fool (yes, we know their checkered history) did publish an interesting review of the recent market action.

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/07/why-digital-world-acquisition-stock-skyrocketed-42/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm\_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm\_medium=feed&amp;utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/07/why-digital-world-acquisition-stock-skyrocketed-42/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article)

This particular SPAC is certainly worth watching.  For those invested in the more traditional media platforms (Disney, Viacom, NY Times, FB... even RMBL), those holdings may be due for a review.

Earnings date: Feb 16 

Alright, here's a play even the most dim witted of you can follow. If any of you have been paying any attention to the GPU and graphics cards market you'd have realized one thing by now. You're shit out of luck if you want to buy a graphics card in the current market - they've been sold out for quite a while now and if you want to buy 1 then be ready to shell out $3k-$4k.. There's even a Japanese retailer selling these babies, the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500. That's right, let that sink in. These bad boys are selling for 3x the MSRP and NVIDIA is set to launch the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, you guessed it, right before earnings. Source:[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/european-pricing-emerges-rtx-3090-ti](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/european-pricing-emerges-rtx-3090-ti)

Moreover, there had been a severe shortage of GPUs and graphics cards over the past year thanks to the Zuck buying a bunch from NVIDIA for his little VR porn project. Coupled with the fact that virgin gamers around the world are ravenous to get their hands on one of these bad boys when the new lot is out guarantees it will be sold out instantly. 

Don't believe me? Okay believe the smart money then: One of the world‚Äôs largest public pensions by assets made major changes in its investments in large-cap tech stocks as 2021 came to a close. PGGM of Zeist, Netherlands, cut investments in [Apple ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/aapl),  [Intel](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/intc)(INTC), and [Qualcomm ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/qcom)(QCOM) stock in the fourth quarter, and initiated a position in [Nvidia ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/nvda)(NVDA) stock.

I would like to end this by saying this is the real world and although NVDA has beat expected earnings 5 years in a row, anything can happen and I do not want to be responsible for any of you having to drink your piss to survive, but if there was a play to bet the house on, this would be it."

wallstreetbet,"The ONLY sure play right nowThese are confusing times for us, my smooth-brained Ape siblings.  Most of the info out there is so polarizing:

* This is just a slight correction/ This is a deadcat bounce.  Crash incoming
* Fed won't really raise rates. Fed has to raise rates
* TSLA is worth $62/share.  TSLA can hit $2000/share

Anyway, it looks like we all have a 50/50 chance of degrading ourselves behind a fast food chain sooner than later.  I don't like this Casino's odds right now and I want guaranteed tendies again.

**Obviously, the best way to make guaranteed money is by doing what this wrinkle-brained ape said 6 months ago:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p26zj4/how\_to\_beat\_the\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p26zj4/how_to_beat_the_market/)

*However, some of you apes aren't allowed within 500 feet of a school and the rest of us are too dumb to become teachers so there really is only one logical play left for most of us:*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Apply to tons of grad schools for an MBA. One will have to accept you.  Literally any school will do(except for the University of Phoenix.  We had a guy with his MBA from there and all the bosses just called him Phoenix instead of Dave.  Dave never got promoted and was constantly mocked until he quit.  Don't be Dave)
2. Take out as many **FEDERAL** loans as you can get. They are free money. The government will keep deferring the repayment of these loans due to perpetual upcoming elections and the indefinite existence of COVID.  Eventually some politician will forgive all loans when the amount-owed is determined to be negligible due to runaway inflation.
3. Graduate and Apply for a job as an ANALyst.  Make sure you say buzz words like ""Beta' ,'DCF' 'Porter's Five forces' and 'SWOT analysis.'  This will indicate that you actually got a worthless MBA. *Do not, for any reason, mention WSB during the interview*
4. Once you have convinced some sucker to hire you, simply follow the rules of being an ANALyst

**HOW TO BE AN ANALYST(it's really this easy):**

\-If you work at Company A, just copy what the Company B analyst says. 

*Fun fact:* Other analysts will provide charts and all the other research that you will need to create your own presentations and charts.  Always set your price target slightly higher than those other analysts.  Think of it like the Price is Right.

\-Wait til earnings come out and then revise your estimate based on market movement.  For example, this week, reset your AMZN target for $3500 since it appears to be going back up.  Set your FB target for $215 since it obviously tanked and your previous $420.69 target is clearly not going to work out anymore.   As for any stock you own illegally, make sure to set those targets really high to capitalize on the quick upward movement when your upgrade has been released.  Then sell immediately those positions and revise your estimates down due to something like .....'supply chain constraints'. 

*Fun fact:* As an analyst, you are allowed to change your mind.And remember, the SEC is not prosecuting anyone these days so why would they start with you?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Total potential market for handjobs from dudes behind Wendy's is only roughly $32 million annually.  if all 11.6 million apes start doing this that only leaves about a $3 average yearly income.  Become an ANALyst instead and get paid guaranteed money for making shit up.  

**\*\*Digression:\*\***Why are all you rookies still giving HJs behind Wendy's?  Wendy's layouts offer horrible concealment for this. Think about how much easier it would be to jerk off dudes behind a Chipotle or Five Guys without a drive-thru line exposing every upstroke.  Plus if you choose restaurants with higher prices ,you are more likely to gain clients with higher disposable incomes... and eventually charge more.

wallstreetbet,"Rocket is gonna crashRocket ($RKT) reports Q4 earnings Thursday, 2/24 after market close.

They are the largest mortgage originator in the country. And they are about to have a really bad year.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect earnings to miss. And Q1 guidance will be horrible. 

# Looking back at Q3

From their press release:

* 88.0B closed loan origination volume
* 3.05% gain-on-sale margin (GOSM)
* 49.6B retail with GOSM 4.47%
* 37.7B partner with GOSM 0.78%

&amp;#x200B;

# Q4 2021 guidance

* Closed loan volume of between $75 billion and $80 billion.
* Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%.

&amp;#x200B;

So they guided lower volume and lower margins. The lower volume is not surprising due to seasonal trends (I think every single lender projected lower Q4 volume).

But the lower margins are interesting. This is probably due to increasing competition for less volume, combined with increasing wholesale market share (with lower margins).

# Mortgage servicing rights (MSR)

* Unpaid principal balance at the end of Q3: $521 billion. These are becoming much more valuable with higher rates.
* They haven‚Äôt been growing it as fast and aggressively as some competitors, but still it is an impressive amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Q1 guidance

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. 

Volume is quite low across the industry. Refinances are down over 50% (see below).

So how much will this plummet in refi volume affect Rocket? They don‚Äôt release their purchase numbers, but let‚Äôs try to predict:

UWMC estimates Rocket has 88% refi (source: UWMC November investor presentation available at [https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc\_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation\_Final.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation_Final.pdf) 

&amp;#x200B;

Rocket had only 27% purchase in 2019, well before the huge refinance boom, as disclosed on their S1.

 [https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/) 

&amp;#x200B;

On their Q3 earnings release, Rocket proclaimed ‚ÄúQ3 2021 represented Rocket Mortgage's strongest purchase closed loan volume in company history. Our purchase volume grew 70% over Q3 2020 levels.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Total volume from Q3 2020 and Q3 2021 were nearly identical. Yet purchase volume increased 70%. 

To give Rocket the benefit of the doubt, let‚Äôs assume they had 12% purchase in Q3 2020, before the 70% growth they cite, and a full year before UWMC estimated Rocket with 12% purchase mix. 

* Q3 2020: 89B
* 53.5B retail
* 29.6B partner

&amp;#x200B;

**If 12%/88% ratio:**

* 10.7B purchase in Q3 2020
* Add 70% and you get 18.2B purchase in Q3 2021, now 21% purchase

&amp;#x200B;

**If 15%/85% ratio:**

* 13.35B purchase in Q3 2020
* Add 70% and you get 22.7B purchase for Q3 2021, now 26% purchase

&amp;#x200B;

# Another issue for rocket in Q1: Rate lock problems

Mortgage rates are rising exponentially. A rate lock in January may be significantly lower rate than the rate at origination a few weeks later. Longer times to close could have a big impact in Q1. It‚Äôs likely we won‚Äôt see any effects of this until Q1 earnings though. 

# Other data to support this

loanDepot ($LDI) projected Q1 volume to drop by 8%-30%, and a huge drop in gain-on-sale margins:

[https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc\_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Now let‚Äôs look at the publicly available mortgage data (h/t u/lymondfc).

**VA data:** [https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender\_Statistics.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender_Statistics.asp)   

ALL

Total Loan Amount

* 3rd Qtr: $103,822,920,824
* 4th Qtr: $92,468,433,277 (10.9% decrease)

&amp;#x200B;

Rocket

Total Loan Amount

* 3rd Qtr: $7,319,511,113
* 4th Qtr: $6,214,143,673 **(15.1% decrease)**

&amp;#x200B;

**FHA Data:** [https://www.hud.gov/program\_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap) 

ALL

Total Loan Amount

* 3rd Qtr: $85,650,768,830
* 4th Qtr: $75,879,038,007 **(**12.9% decrease)

Rocket

Total Loan Amount

* 3rd Qtr: $6,479,459,993
*  4th Qtr: $5,461,202,656 (**18.5% decrease)**

&amp;#x200B;

Volume down 15.1% and 18.5% in both data points. Let‚Äôs take the average, down 16.8%.

That makes $72B volume, clearly missing guidance. 

Yet **even if we assume high end of guidance, $80B Q4 volume, it's still a mess:**

* 21% purchase: $16.8B
* 79% refi: $63.2B

Up to:

* 25% purchase: $20B
* 75% refi: $60B

&amp;#x200B;

One month ago, when rates were even lower, MBA estimated a 50% drop in refinance volume from a year ago. Surely it's higher than 50% now. Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since then.

# Putting it all together with only a 50% drop in refinance volume

**Q1: $48-$50B total origination volume**

That‚Äôs a 33%-38% drop from Q4 projected volume. 

**Q1 2022 volume likely will be Rocket‚Äôs worst origination volume since they did $40.1B in Q3 2019, down over 50% from $103B in Q1 2021.**

Even if they hit their high end of guidance for Q4.

EVEN WITH VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES of refi volume drop. 

This is lower than pre-pandemic levels:

Q4 2019: $50.8B

Q1 2020: $51.7B

&amp;#x200B;

Margins are dropping too.

# TL;DR

$RKT will miss earnings and issue horrible Q1 guidance due to plummeting refinance volumes.

Rocket will have a rough year.

wallstreetbet,"ESTC - Elastic - Strong financials and settled a lawsuit with AmazonI've been in and out of this trade since 2019. In 2019, elastic sued Amazon for trademark infringement. They settled last week on ""undisclosed terms"". Elastic also had a major management change a couple weeks ago which caused a massive one day price drop. Shay Bannon, the founder and former CEO dropped to CTO and a new CEO was brought in. Earnings are being announced a bit later than expected on March 3. During the announcement of the change of CEO, Shay Bannon already said that they will beat on revenue and earnings:

[https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-promotes-ashutosh-kulkarni-to-ceo](https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-promotes-ashutosh-kulkarni-to-ceo)

No competitors other than the companies who have forked their software. I'm a software engineer. My company uses elasticsearch. There's no chance we would use a fork of elasticsearch because of the potential for it to get abandoned.

I think they are going to do well on earnings, but I predict the big news here will be a new partnership with Amazon. The CEO change and the lawsuit settlement (which, if taken to court would have resulted in a victory for elastic) occuring so close together combined with a slightly delayed earnings announcement leads me to believe that something big will be announced during the earnings call. Combined with 43% YoY revenue growth and a P/S of only around 9-10, this is a slam dunk earnings play.

wallstreetbet,"Foolproof 5-10x Options Trade on deep value Tech StocksAs all of you may know, tech stocks have been getting completely crushed, even though the Indices like QQQ and SPY haven't dropped that much.

Just take a look at this Reddit post showing how much tech stocks have dropped from their peak.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/swwvyt/when\_the\_stocksmarket\_will\_crash/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/swwvyt/when_the_stocksmarket_will_crash/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  


On top of that, stocks are currently crashing for two reasons:  
1. The Fed has finally inversed themselves and are wanting to raise interest rates.  
2. Ukraine crisis

Options Plan:  
Wait for Ukraine crisis to play out to see if Russia does in fact invade or if they truly back off. As soon as the news breaks out, wait for stocks to start bouncing.

If stocks continue to go down after the invasion, wait for the Fed to announce that they won't be raising interest rates as quickly as before because they won't need to because of the war. 

If you don't think stocks will rally, and if stocks continue heading down, you should wait until the Fed reverses their decision to increase rates and instead starts pumping the money printer again. 

As soon as one of those things happens, find a tech stock that has dropped significantly over the past few months from its peak. Make sure it's a high conviction stock that has an extremely low chance of going bankrupt.  


For example, Robinhood, Meta, Square, Paypal, Docusign, Viacom, etc. Stuff that the industry NEEDS going forward. 

For example, Square is unlikely to fail because they cover both cash transactions AND they're getting into coins as well. A lot of people use the cash app.

Another example, Meta or Facebook is extremely unlikely to go bankrupt because so many people use FaceBook, Whatsapp, Instagram, etc. Plus, if the metaverse succeeds, they'll skyrocket.

  
Final step of the plan: Once the Ukraine Crisis outcome is confirmed, either invasion or whatever else..  
Wait until you start seeing stocks bounce a bit and then buy the furthest out expiration date call option (3 years out) at a Breakeven price about halfway between the current price and the peak.  


For example, $FB peak was $378. The current price is $206. Set the breakeven price to around $292, which would currently be the $265 1/19/2024 call. 

Then, simply leave it for 3 years until expiration or whenever you're happy with the profit. If stocks go lower over the next few months after purchase, you still have over 2 years to recover.

In the 2018 taper tantrum crash, it only took a year for QQQ to come back to the 2018 peak.  
In the COVID crash, it only took 6 months. 

The only way you can lose is if we enter a massive recession or depression, and at that point, the couple of thousand bucks you spent on these options won't matter anymore since cash won't really matter anymore.

For example, the 2000 Dot Com bubble took 15 years to recover. That's the worst case scenario, but I think that's a very special case that doesn't apply anymore since tech is established and we can't live without it.

Thoughts?

Current position: SPY $443 Put 2/28 waiting for Ukraine outcome."
wallstreetbet,"Time to Get Ridian of Another Overvalued EV StartupRivian Automotive held up quite well during the rather bloody days of Thursday and Friday last week.

At a 60b Market Cap, I believe they have some room to fall, as Lucid, NIO, and XPeng have fallen to the 30b-40b range.

Rivian earnings are 3/10. They missed badly for Q3 earnings when they only built a few cars for employees.

Some Reasons Price Could Hold:
1. Their lockup expiration isn‚Äôt until May
2. Strong investor base of Amazon, Ford, T Rowe Price, George Soros
3. TA bollinger bands are narrowing and RSI is healthy around 55 on most time frames (Any TA experts please correct me if wrong)
4. They have almost 20b in cash and big contracts to fulfill orders for Amazon

Some Reasons Price Could Fall:
1. For all of 2021, they produced only 1015 cars and delivered 920 [(Article)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/559907/rivian-production-delivery-numbers-2021/amp/)
2. In this macro environment, Rivian is worth 60b with no revenue, fcf, profit and they will have increasing costs as they attempt to build a new factory in GA [(Article)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/559907/rivian-production-delivery-numbers-2021/amp/)
3. They need to produce 2 cars at rapid pace without losing ground to all the legacy competitors, according to Dan Ives, while dealing with the ongoing shortage of semiconductors. Also, Rivian received criticism about shady actions in this [NYT Article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/business/rivian-stock-electric-cars.amp.html)
4. Last week all the EVs, and stocks in general, fell with the rest of the macro, except Rivian. If TSLA falls hard soon, maybe Rivian will finally fall in simpathy?
5. Q4 Earnings 3/10, FOMC Meeting 3/15

I see a lot more downside potential than upside, not sure what investor would want to buy stock in a very early car maker in this environment of chip shortages and tightening monetary policy. I‚Äôm looking for Rivian to fall toward its low of $50, which will be a 20% loss from here.

I am totally open to any feedback if this play is a bad idea. I definitely want to know if I‚Äôm wrong so I can exit this play with the profit I have before it turns against me. DEVIL‚ÄôS ADVOCATES ARE WELCOME!

TL;DR - How is Rivian still worth $60b? How did they have a +10% week of 2/14 on no company news and a slew of bad macro news? Sell your shares, buy puts, this will fall from $60b to the $40b mkt cap range.

I'm bullish on sleep apnea stocks. Over a billion people have sleep apnea worldwide, it goes undiagnosed in 80% of cases, and increases the risk of the leading causes of death such as heart attack, stroke, cancer, accidents, and diabetes. I personally believe this sector will do well as millennials age and awareness increases on social media. The sleep apnea devices market is expected to have a [CAGR of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sleep-apnea-devices-market-size-worth-6-1-billion-by-2028-cagr-6-2-grand-view-research-inc-1030292947). Resmed is the world‚Äôs top CPAP manufacturer. CPAPs are the most effective treatment for sleep apnea.

Resmed (RMD) is my number one holding in my portfolio. I think they have a decent chance of growing to be as large as a company like Eli Lilly within the next 10-20 years. It all depends on whether or not the US Government decides to pursue a mass screening approach for sleep apnea. This is currently being debated in the [US Preventative Services Task Force](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-update-summary/obstructive-sleep-apnea-adults-screening). To reiterate, about a billion people worldwide have sleep apnea and it goes undiagnosed in about 80% of cases. [Check](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300334/) this article on pub med.

My mid cap holdings:

1. Resmed (RMD).
2. Koninklijke Phillips (PHG). Also a CPAP manufacturer.

My higher risk growth plays are below:

1. Inspire Medical (INSP). They created an implant for sleep apnea, analogous to a pacemaker, to keep airways open at night. I think they have a good shot long term.
2. LivaNova (LIVN). UK equivalent of Inspire Medical, but their business is more diversified.
3. Nyxoah (NYXH). Super risky and less proven than Inspire, but less invasive of a product. Some of their startup capital came from Resmed.
4. Vivos Therapeutics (VVOS). Ultra small cap and could go bankrupt, but more risk more reward if their business pays off. They have a product that‚Äôs like a mouth guard, that expands airways to help prevent sleep apnea. They rely on dentists to diagnose and sell the product.
5. Sleep Number (SNBR). There‚Äôs some press that the company will develop more sleep tech to help with sleep apnea. My hope is that the company tries to acquire #3 or #4 to have a more integrated sleep solution.

I own all these companies with Resmed and Inspire being the bulk of my portfolio. I‚Äôm bullish on the space, but recognize that some of the small caps could have issues if not out right bankruptcies.

wallstreetbet,"Show Me The Flaw In This Perfect StrategyAlright, my dealy regarded. I'm pretty uneducated, and I've been working on a strategy that can ""guarantee"" returns. I know there's no guarantees in the market, or everyone would do it, so I need someone smarter than me \[so basically anyone\] to show me the flaw in this approach. I'm gonna use current numbers even though it's weekend, so just play along.

&amp;#x200B;

I buy 100 shares of NVDA for $232. I then sell a NVDA $225C for $15.20. This means, if my shares get called away, my $23,200 investment just netted me \~$800, or 3.4% return. However, I'm scared of the market right now, so I also buy a NVDA $225P for $3.90, bring my profit upon shares getting called away to $410, or \~1.7%. Help me see the scenarios were I make less than \~1.7% on this position.

&amp;#x200B;

If the shares DON'T get called away, so NVDA drops to or below $252, my break even price on the shares is $216.8, at which point I will have made no money on the premium. Anything below that will start to be a loss on the trade. However, if we go the insurance route, that put is now worth at least $8.20, which is over a 100% gain on the put.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I'm doing this on margin. So I can actually buy 200 shares of NVDA for that ""same"" cash balance of $23,200, which essentially doubles the % return in both scenarios. My mindset is that during the current uncertainty, I'd always play with insurance on hand, but once we get back to some sort of predictability or baseline with these stocks, I think the insurance can be foregone if the trader \[ME\] is willing to hold shares a bit and continue to sell calls against them at any price between cost basis and original strike price.

&amp;#x200B;

After typing this up, I see this wouldn't work on a stock where the puts are more expensive than the calls, but I wonder if there's just a reverse scenario where you can do this, most likely not with margin, since I think it would instead require selling puts as the basis."

wallstreetbet,"Taking SS benefits early and investing in market. Your thoughtsI am a CPA and am asking advise from Apes on WSB.  Shows I belong here.  I am turning 64 and am eligible to start taking Social Security.  I have always been told to wait until I am 70 so I get the largest amount.  Here are my thoughts.

There are other factors to consider, like tax rates and your belief if SS will be around, that is just noise in the background.  I am using actual amounts for this example.  I can start recieving $2,500 per month right now.  Since it will be coming monthly it will go into the market (ETF) it is a very good dollar cost average.  After 5 years I will have put $150,000 into the market and will have accumulated well over $200,000 assuming 10% a year appreciation.

If I had waited until 70 I can recieve $3,700 per month in benefits.  Since I would already have $200,000 working for me in the market which would produce $20,000 per year in income I think I will be way ahead of the game but more importantly I am making my own investment decisions not the government.  You Apes have any thoughts.  Smart ass comments are also appreciated."

- I‚Äôm able to process multiple languages so I would also be able to analyze medias who is not in English, allowing it to analyze stocks in different countries.

- The output would be something like a newsletter containing a ranking of the found stocks per month. Further more I would also allow filtering so one could see the popularity of the found stocks in different markets e.g. pharmaceutical.

(PHASE 2)                                                                                                                                                                               we get twitter to cancel all their most profitable shows and upcoming shows and any shows that would make them money. canceling all the alt accounts and the accounts we use this will severely kill their users by around 10 million a conservative estimate of just 100,000 ppl doing this if we then get 5-10 more ppl to cancel their subscriptions that's around another 500,000 to 1000,000 users. we all yolo into deep otm puts exp on the days after they announce their q2 earnings, we also sell naked itm calls exp on the same days.

(PHASE 3)                                                                                                                                                                        analysts will have bullish ratings on Netflix earnings and the options market will be overpricing calls because of the last earnings call being inflated with fake accounts. the last earnings where netflix reported 8.3 mil user growth which was under their expectations caused their stock to tank 20% if they  lose 11 million users their stock will tank at least 40-70% over several days     

(PHASE 4)                                                                                                                                                                                     u realise cramer was bearish on Netflix and get margin called and have 69mil in debt with ur broker           ya welcome retards prepare some rope cause ur gonna need it i need help deciding which type of rope im gonna use"

Our Comrades Apes are worried in Russia.

Many of then are being called to the Ukraine front. Consequences:
- they are not able to participate in WSB forum since the communications are jammed fr reddit and not for porn.hub
- they leave their russian wife's alone and those tchetchenia boyfriends are going to use credit card to the limit
- worst, they can't go behind Moscow Wendy's to get a free handjob from Vladimir.

This is a serious issue and i suggest we need as community to show our ape comradeship. Possible interventions:
- puts on all Russian companies, including oil gas vodka and caviar; except daterussiangirls.com
- calls on visitcrimeia.com, Ukraine commodities like corn, wheat, potatoes and girls (for WSB sugardaddies) and boys (for WSB sugarmomies).

wallstreetbet,"Everyone cancel NetflixListen up retards. Now recently most of us have become aware that Netflix is hiking their rates again. Im sure there reasoning is so that they can bring more drool secretions to the masses. Perhaps inflation is even cutting into their production costs. Like the benevolent movie theater killers that they are they just was to provide more content for families across The world so we can all escape our miserable lives and spend as much time in front of the TV watching mind numbing content. I love eating tendies on the couch, pounding beer and watching Movies. Besides watching all of you degenerates lose small fortunes and posting your losses online‚Ä¶zoning out on my couch is one of my favorite pastimes. Why? Cus im a lazy fat American. 

However. I dont want to pay 20 bucks a month to do it. So I propose this. There are a little over 11 million users on Wallstreet Regrets, even if half of you cancel your membership that will create a reasonable downside to this rate hike. Hell tell your friends and family too (ya know the ones who arent using your subscription to Netflix) and maybe we can put a real dent in their bottom line. In other words. Fuck your Netflix calls, cancel your subscription and buy puts.

I feel as if a massive growth into 13-14$ is likely‚Ä¶the super bowl was hosted in SoFi Stadium, I couldn‚Äôt have been the only person that saw that and went wow SoFi has a football stadium? Turns out they do. 
   So that I feel brought forth more customers, amongst other things SoFi is becoming more reputable as a source and overall more popular, it seems to becoming solidified as a true money lending option compared to banks as it seems to be both friendlier and less expensive tax and interest wise. 
   However, these earnings are for Q4 of 2021, so, here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking, if SoFi is gaining traction, I feel a real deal price would be 16-18$, a growth into 13-14$ for Q4 2021 earnings seems like a solid bet into an eventual 16-18$ into Q1 2022 earnings, SoFi seems heavily undervalued and looking at call interest relative to put interest 12-15$ calls for march 4th and 11th are becoming highly sought after, plan? 13.5 calls for march 4th 2022
Position- 10, 13.5 calls for March 4th, 2022

I am known for my chart readings, if you have followed me you know I have predicted and made a hefty gain on  CPB chart, ZNGA chart, BBIG chart, TSN chart. I am 4/5 correct, failing on BNGO as I believed manipulation would go the opposite way. My belief is SoFi will reach 13$ by March 4th because of the crown chart. Noted in this image you will see the three prongs that form the crown, the rim of the crown, the chart leading up to prong action, has a 3 month average, March brings it into the 3rd month for the down trend rim, however, if you notice the trend, it has a monthly high low and with earnings being released the new high low I believe will be in the 12-13$ range, with SoFi being a hyped stock this final new high low ending the crown pattern should fall higher than expected. Essentially meaning these call contracts would be mini lottery plays making at least 40% gain in my opinion

However more importantly the level on 21st of Jan is $5.00 and there are over **$1 billion** worth of ape money to be burned as those calls were opened during the meme hype in Jan 2021. Every cent closer to $5.00 makes more money to banks.

Why was $NOK part of the four main meme stocks? (BANG = BB, AMC, Nokia and GME)  
The reason is that Keith Gill alias u/deepfuckingvalue saw it as a potentially undervalued stock ([pic of his notebook in WSJ article](https://ibb.co/j6FFqG6)). He truly is a value investor and the hype was a consequence of huge amount of degenerates following him. Many stocks made a short squeeze but for Nokia it was more like a gamma squeeze and actually returning to a reasonable valuation level. Price doubled in one day with massive 1.2 billion volume (share count high but market value low compared to peers in telecom sector).

So, the share price for $NOK was around $4.00 last year January and now it's over $6.00. It's fair to say that DFV was right. Nokia has been making a great turnaround and future looks bright.

More or less this post is just a heads up for all value investor as the stock is currently battered and sold in my opinion with discounted price (Naked shorts based shares dumped to the market?). Make your own DD and buy if you see the potential (I'm not financial advisor).

Meanwhile it seems clear that market makers will maximize their profit and make some of you poor (personally I don't have any of those options but I feel you). Long-term investors will most likely focus on 3rd of Feb when Nokia will announce their plan to revive dividends and give future outlook. Company has a huge net cash, strong cashflow, second to none products in the industry and it's main competitor Chinese Huawei is suffering from US ban so despite of the short term headwinds caused by market manipulation the future seems promising."

Us inflation hit a 39-year high, setting the stage for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in MarchUs consumer prices have surged at their fastest pace in nearly 40 years, underscoring the need for the Federal Reserve to withdraw its easy money policy as soon as possible and setting the stage for an interest rate rise as early as March. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent month-on-month in December 2021, beating expectations of 0.4 percent, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. That left the figure as expected up 7 per cent from a year earlier, the biggest rise since June 1982 and up from 6.8 per cent in November.

wallstreetbet,"Why Saudi's PIF will inevitably have to buy more Lucid shares (and won't sell LCID upon lockup expiration)We are just a week away from the second Lucid lockup expiration and I have received lots of emails and messages inquiring about PIF sell off. For PIF, controlling interest (having majority ownership) matters way more than incidental immaterial small financial gains. In this post I am showing why PIF will inevitably have to buy more Lucid shares instead of selling, and the sooner they do it the cheaper it will be for them. Let‚Äôs look at the ownership structure immediately after July IPO

&amp;#x200B;

[Share ownership structure as of July 25, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/dqqmf59a5fb81.jpg?width=811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=602378b3c14f59778de32b3ccbcb0b1f81950299)

  

However, since July lots of things have changed (and PIF stake has been diluted). The following has been added to the float

\- 41,400,000 public warrants were redeemed cashless (0.4458 conversion, **assuming\*** all warrants have been redeemed cashless, 18,456,120 shares have been added to the float)

\- 44,350,000 private placement warrants have been redeemed for cash (**assuming\*** they were all redeemed for cash, evident by cash on Balance sheet as of 9/30/2021, estimated 44,350,000 have been added to the float, however 14,283,333 of it is locked due to clawback clauses)

\- Lucid convertible notes maturing in Dec 2026 in the amount of $2,012,500,000 implies 36,737,861 shares will be issued in Dec 2026 ONLY and ONLY IF (**assuming\***) the company decides to pay back the debtholders all with shares.

\- 68,121,210 stock options could be issued during the next several years (**assuming\*** all will be issued)

\- 43,409,870 RSUs could be issued during the next several years (**assuming\*** all will be issued)

**\*Please note that I made several assumptions which might or might not be true or materialize in the future**.

Just add all above (211,075,061 shares) and you will see that if they are added to the total outstanding shares of 1,618,621,534 shares, the PIF ownership percentage is naturally on track to shrink to 55% in the next few years (vs. 62.7% in July 2021). Lucid is in a very capital-intensive business and will definitely need further rounds of capital raising during the next 3-4 years, which could be in the form of equity offering (another assumption) and those offering will dilute PIF further, bringing their ownership percentage closer to \[or even below\] 50%. Since they will definitely need to have a controlling interest in Lucid, they will inevitably have to either take part in all of the future equity offerings (which will definitely come at a much higher valuation), OR, they need to beef up their ownership and buy more stocks NOW while the stock is still cheap (relative to what it could be in 2023, 2024, 2025 or any future year that the offering might come). This implies that Saudi PIF with its massive $800B reserves (which is growing so fast due to high oil price) must increase their ownership today and buy more of Lucid stocks to eliminate any remote chance of losing their controlling interest in the future, or they will have to pay way more in the future to keep their controlling interest. For the reason above, not only PIF will not sell any shares after lock-up expiration, but they will likely buy (if they haven‚Äôt already) more shares.

However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that there will be no sellers upon lock-up expiration. By reading Lucid S-1 we figure out series A, series B and series C investors own more than 112M shares combined (Saudis were Series D &amp; Series E investors who made arrangement that Lucid buys back most of series C investors when Saudis invested in Series D, another sign that from those early days Saudis were thinking about establishing a controlling interest, and another implication that Saudis might buy early investors‚Äô shares off-exchange during the next few days). Early founders and non-senior managers &amp; employees and executives also own over 30M shares. Any of these individuals or early investors might sell their shares after lock-up expiration and if they do all at once on Jan 20th, it makes a set up similar to Sep 1 sell off. Let‚Äôs review what happened on Sep 1 and compare the situation with today. 

During the last 5 days of August, Lucid stock fell from $22.83 to $19.96 (-12.5%) before falling from $19.96 to $16.12 (-19%) premarket on September 1 on 60M volume, however the stock bounced back off of lows and closed the day at $17.80 on massive 149M daily volume (15x average daily volume compared to August). It took the stock 3 days to fully recover the 19% dip. Prior to the lock up expiration, 42M short interest (with 143% borrowing fee) existed on 207M \[CCIV shareholders\] float (42M /207M = 20% of the float was shorted). The PIPE owned 153.33M shares (excluding PIF‚Äôs 13.3M shares), the daily volume was 149M on Sep 1 and 60M of it was premarket (So 60M PIPE sell off happened pre-market! Of course it implies big buyers also bought 60M shares pre-market). The options market during the last 5 days leading to Sep 1 was also interesting. The put option open interests were lower than call options open interest and put premiums were lower than call premiums for September 3 expiration. 

Back to today, there are a few similarities and a few differences. The float today consists of the following shares:

&amp;#x200B;

[Free Float as of Dec 31, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/r284p9px5fb81.jpg?width=783&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a7f9404ca720566b70ca1a75cf98e82ca5f8aab)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Please note the reduction in daily volume following the large purchase of shares by mutual funds and ETFs that passively track Nasdaq (Nasdaq inclusion)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily volume before and after Dec 17, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/lcpig8pe6fb81.jpg?width=821&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cda5752d493d03a6cfd662ff2ce92e188eac361)

  

The short interest (as of 12/31/2021) is 90M shares (107% borrowing fee as of 1/12/2022), so on the float of 408.8M, it is 22% of the float (90M/408.8M) and on the free float of 340M, it is close to 26.5% (90M/340M), this implies that short interest relative to the free float is 30% higher than late August. This implies that there is a much bigger betting against Lucid this time. 

The number of shares susceptible to sell off is 168M (early investors, founders and non-executive employees), which is higher than the 153M in September. It is impossible to predict what % of those 168M will sell, but PIPE investors bought the shares for $15 and sold them as soon as they could on Sep 1 for very tiny gains (they waited 7 months). Early investors and founders who gain the ability to sell on Jan 20 have bought the shares for single digits and they have waited several years and the stock price is way higher than September. Judgment is up to the reader whether they are more likely or less likely to sell. Assuming these investors sell all their shares on Jan 20 (starting premarket and continuing through out the day) and assuming the stock price close at $45 on Jan 19th, we should expect a similar 20% dip in the stock (to $35 - $36) on January 20th. Even if this scenario happens, I expect a sharp rebound to +$50 during the week of January 24 

Unlike Sep 3 option market, the option market for Jan 21 shows that put options are more expensive than call options and open interest on put options is larger than open interest on call options.

Unlike the last 2 weeks leading to Sep 1 when the stock price was under pressure, the stock price trend has been upward during the last 2 weeks leading to Jan 19. 

It is not deniable that the bet against Lucid stock is massive, evident by 90M short interest ($4B bet), but it is also important to emphasize that if the sell off doesn‚Äôt materialize according to short sellers‚Äô expectations, the melt up is going to be spectacular. 

Few strategies to ride the event through options market (depending on short-term bullish view or short-term bearish view):

**Short term Bearish view:** 

\- If you have any shares with cost basis above $35, you may buy protective put options for strikes between $35 and $45 for January 21st to protect your gains. Concurrently you may sell cash-secured put options for strikes between $30 - $35 to help off-set the cost of the put options you buy (or instead buy the shares on the market or through limit order if it dips to $30 - $35 zone)

\- If your cost basis is below $30, you shouldn‚Äôt be stressed as much as the investor with cost basis above $35. You may still protect your gains and even buy the shares cheaper through bearish put spread, or you may sit tight on your cash and buy shares with market order when it dips

**Short term** **Bullish view:**

\- If you believe the sell off won‚Äôt materialize and shorts will need to cover and buy shares instead and hence the stock will skyrocket, you may buy $45 - $55 strike call options (and still finance a portion of it by selling cash-secured puts if you are truly a stock buyer if it dips)

\- If you believe the rise in stock will be moderate, you may buy $45 - $50 call options and sell $55-$60 \[covered\] call options to offset a portion of the call option you bought (bullish call spread) 

Stay assured that PIF won‚Äôt sell any shares. PIF is supposed to pay and build a whole factory in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs NEOM CITY for Lucid, so they can start producing cars there. If they sell even a small amount of their shares and lose their controlling interest, they ruin their plans to make Saudi Arabia an EV manufacturing hub in the Middle East (Google NEOM city and the $500B project building it)

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck and stay confident Lucid will win the race in mid-to-long term.

&amp;#x200B;

This research was initially prompted by seeing the former Chair, Joint Chiefs of Staff, having given up his lucrative positions on the boards of GM and Sprint, not only working for a not-often-discussed investment company but chairing the board of comparatively rinky-dink little Precinmac. As it turned out, that was the first step on what became a long walk.

1/

ADM Mike Mullen chairs the board of Precinmac. Precinmac is a defense-focused hi-spec parts and components machining company.

Pine Island acquired Precinmac on 1 APR 2020 with two other partners: Bain Capital and Compass Partners. Bain is Mitt Romney's twelve-digit AUM cash firehose. Compass Capital is the product of founder Stephen M. Waters. He has interesting connections to what we see in Pine Island.

Compass Capital's only other major holding is Nautilus Integrated Solutions, a defense-focused hi-spec parts and components machining company. Compass chose VADM John Morgan as President and CEO of NIS. Look them up and Waters and Morgan were directors at the U.S. Naval Institute together c. 2011.

Go further back and Mullen and Morgan were CNO and Deputy CNO together c. 2007. They published the Navy's current strategy ""A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower"" that year.

Now Mullen and Morgan are each boss of a defense manufacturer owned in whole or in part by Compass Capital.

This is the primary loop in Pine Island.

üì∑

2/

Mike Mullen graduated the Naval Academy in 1968. MajGen Charles Bolden, a Pine Island partner, is a classmate of the same graduating year.

LtGen Vincent Stewart was Director of the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity for most of the time Mike Mullen was Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. MCIA is an hour down the highway from the Pentagon in Quantico, VA.

Gen Lloyd Austin, a former Pine Island partner, was made Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2009-2010. Mike Mullen appointed him. ""Austin credited the appointment as having jumpstarted his later career, saying: 'People who might not have known Lloyd Austin began to know him.'"" \[Wikipedia\]. Austin is on the board of directors of RTX. So is David Wajsgras, a Pine Island partner.

All the retired flag officers we see, or will see, connected with Pine Island were in the Department of the Navy \[besides former partner Lloyd Austin\], be it the Navy itself or the Marine Corps. All of them know, or probably know, Mike Mullen. Stephen Waters is also ex-Navy, having retired out as a lieutenant.

Stephen Waters is a director on the board of Valero, the TX-based oil corporation.

Of the five ex-congressmen partnered with PIPP, all of them were in Congress in at least some position together from 1995 to 2005. Most of them peaked their congressional careers during the 107th and 108th Congresses at the start of the War on Terror, 2001-2005.

Don Nickles was the Senate R. Whip 1996-2003, the #2 Republican. Tom Daschle was the Senate D. Leader 1995-2005, the #1 Democrat and his counterpart.

Daschle is a member of the bipartisan Issue One ReFormers Caucus. So are Dick Gephardt and Byron Dorgan. Additionally, Dick Gephardt is a consultant for global law firm DLA Piper, where Saxby Chambliss is a partner.

These Congressmen's connections in subcommittees, their important Congressional positions, and their post-Congress lobbying and consulting careers are detailed in the attached.

Stephen Waters lives and works around Greenwich, CT, a popular spot for investment firms and hedge funds. Compass Capital itself is in Stamford, CT. Additionally, Stephen Waters graduated the Harvard Business School in 1974, being involved in alumni committees there ever since.

CNH Partners, a hedge fund subsidiary of AQB Capital Management, is ten minutes down I-95 from Compass Capital. Its three principals all have connections to HBS. Todd Pulvino got his AM and Ph.D from HBS, as well as working there as a visiting professor. Rocky Bryant worked in HBS as a research associate. Mark Mitchell was a professor of finance at Harvard. CNH Partners is an institutional holder of PIPP.

Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund, is directly across from CNH Partners, both companies addressed at 1 &amp; 2 Greenwich Plaza, Greenwich, CT respectively. They share a parking lot. The co-chief investment officer of Aristeia, William Techar, graduated from Harvard with a econ BA. Aristeia Capital is an institutional holder of PIPP.

The three co-founders of Aristeia Capital that Techar works for were all ex-managers at UBS prior to founding Aristeia. UBS is an institutional holder of PIPP‚Äîtwice. Once as UBS AG and once as its Chicago-based affiliate hedge fund UBS O'Connor.

Mike Mullen graduated the Advanced Management Program at HBS in 1991 and has been involved on the board of HBS in the years since. Charles Bolden was selected as a ALI Fellow at HBS in 2009 and attended a summit there in 2014. Vincent Stewart received ""executive training"" (likely the AMP) at HBS.

Michele Flournoy, a Pine Island partner, graduated Harvard with a social studies BA in 1983. Antony Blinken, a former Pine Island partner, graduated Harvard with the same degree in 1984. They founded WestExec Advisors together in 2017.

Flournoy was formerly a director of the Atlantic Council, a think tank and a who's who of the politically influential. Capricia Marshall, a Pine Island partner, is Vice Chair of the Latin America Center Council there.

Capricia Marshall is a member of the board of trustees of the Blair House Restoration Fund in DC. So is Stuart Holliday, a Pine Island partner.

Flournoy, Blinken, and Marshall were all employed in the first Obama administration, 2009-2013.

üì∑

So all the DC partners of Pine Island are interconnected with each other. (If Group Three seems tenuous to the rest, more will be revealed later.)

When Blinken got chosen to be Secretary of State, the NYT ran an article about ""potential conflicts of interest"" in the Biden administration at Pine Island, focusing on Blinken, Flournoy, and their connection together at WestExec, pointing at WestExec's publicly-disclosed connection with private defense company Shield AI. How interesting of the Democrat rag-in-chief running anything critical at all of the Democrat commander-in-chief. Blinken said he divested himself of Pine Island financial interests and the NYT considered the case closed. Austin got a similar, much quieter, treatment in a later article. Then the media never said anything about it again.

How simple. Two partners, one connection. Remember: the elite stop you from knowing what they really don't want you to know and thinking how they really don't want you to think not with news articles but a wall of absolute silence.

How convenient that WestExec, which doesn't publish the full list of its consulting partners, did make public its association with Shield AI in time for the NYT to cry ""wolf!"" and ""case closed!"" in such close succession.

Not to mention that Blinken as SecState is much less influential as an insider, if insider influence there be, than Lloyd Austin, the SecDef. No mention of Austin's public goodwill to Mike Mullen, a Pine Island partner?

As we can see in the chart, the relationships at Pine Island go much deeper than two Democrats at WestExec. But the NYT knew about all this, right? It's all in easy Google searches, takes a morning to turn up. There is no hidden meaning in the NYT's silence. They never, ever, run an article at their masters' behest. The easiest way to preempt controversy is never, ever to call it against yourself.

7/

Really with Pine Island we see a team of use to a defense major and not much else. Two Raytheon execs (Wasjgras, Austin even if he's ""not"" on the team), a lot of Navy brass (group one), a lot of ex-Congressmen active in defense appropriations, intel, and energy (group two), some Obama/Biden insiders (group three), and a group skilled in business and diplomacy with foreign countries (Marshall, Holliday, Pine Island co-founder Clyde Tuggle).

This is overkill for a company trying to duct tape a gun to a quadrotor even if the WestExec-ShieldAI connection isn't just bait. Likewise for whatever SparkCognition pretends its doing. Their few contracts have been with the Army and Air Force so far, and they've already secured private funding and their own team of much less well-connected former DoD people.

Pine Island has the guns for big contracts both with the US and abroad. Competitive contracts. Defense majors fight over those, not wannabe tech startups. None of the people working at Pine Island has to work for a living right now, but there they are, all working together. If they weren't going to spear a big fish they'd be at home.

Pine Island is either going to pull a major Defense company or build one, given their acquisition of supplier company Precinmac. But the partners are mostly old and retired, and have too short a time outlook to build a corporation from the ground up.

But there are more connections.

At the risk of turning the chart into spagetti, here they are.

Neal Blue became CEO of General Atomics in 1986 after buying the compnay from Chevron. His brother, Linden Blue, became Vice Chair of the Board.

Neal Blue is a member of the International Advisory Board of the Atlantic Council. His brother is a director of the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council. It should be noted that both brothers have a strong interest in Latin America: they spent the late 50s flying around Latin America writing articles for the American press, they started a banana and cacao plantation in Nicaragua in 1958, and, according to Linden, what became the MQ-1 Predator arose, in part, to the brothers' interest in helping the Contras in Nicaragua in the late 80s. How interesting that Capricia Marshall is the Vice Chair of the Latin America Center Council at the Atlantic Council. And, as previously forgotten, that Mike Mullen is an honorary director there.

Neal is a member of the board of advisors of the Center for a New American Security. Michele Flournoy co-founded it in 2007.

Linden was a director at Raytheon 1982-1984.

Linden married RADM Ronne Froman in 2013. She had been the Senior VP of GA's Energy Group from 2007, and before that the ranking Navy officer in San Diego, 1997-2000. Froman finished her Navy career as Director of Shore Readiness at the Office of the CNO, 2000-2001. The Director of Surface Warfare at the Office of the CNO 1998-2001 was... Mike Mullen. He became a Deputy CNO in 2001.

Linden previously graduated the Advanced Management School at HBS.

General Atomics could have announced a traditional IPO in the time that PIPP has been active. \[General Atomics is certainly not the target for PIPP. However, it would not be surprising if the target had connections to GA.\] But the connection is there.

Additional Stuff.

Bolden once gave a presentation for the Center for American Progress in 2015. Tom Daschle is the Chairman of the CAP. A major donor to the CAP is Goldman Sachs. Dick Gephardt is a consultant at Goldman, and John Thain and Phil Cooper built their careers there.

General Atomics keeps a business campus at Grand Forks, ND. GA more than tripled its presence there in 2018, the year Pine Island (Capital, not PIPP) was founded. The line from UND in Grand Forks to NDSU in Fargo is the Red River Valley Research Corridor, focusing on hosting tech companies. The federal money to found the Corridor was earmarked by a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee decades ago... Byron Dorgan.

Pine Island, FL lies across the water from John Thain's house on North Captiva Island.

Dorgan is Co-chair of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Energy Project. Tom Daschle co-founded the BPC in 2007.

John Thain got his MBA in 1979 from... the Harvard Business School. Pine Island partner Wm. Russell Mann got his Ph.D in mathematics from Harvard.

Wajsgras is a director at Martin Marietta, where Dorgan had his first job out of college.

Harvard is mentioned, but the next-common runners-up in school connections are Yale and UV. Several of the members have connections to separate schools, institutions, and businesses located in Boston - Waters, Cooper, Bridge, Knox."

wallstreetbet,"$Wish 2022 Full Analysis Reversal Play üíéFirst of all it's not a financial advice so please do your own DD before investing on anything and only invest the amount you are fully prepared to loose! Also if you are a conservative investor, Index fund is far far better and if you are a value investor, there are ton of opportunities out there and always will be. This is a growth bet !
I am long WISH and I might be little biased; however I am in it to make money so I heartily welcome all LONG BEAR points; not short. Short terms are mostly driven by events and not business fundamentals so WISH could go to $2 if people do not like the new CEO for example ! There is no limit how much low a stock can go unfortunately; please go read Peter Lynch. If you are trying to time the market, good luck!! Also if you are a day trader, good luck to you as well !! - I recently read a post from fellow investor who turned over $28 million in a year and was in negative $7600 :) I personally think it's not worth the time and emotional well being.
What I have learned during my 5 years investing journey is that stocks mostly move up and down driven by sentiment; it comes down to demand and supply - if people are willing to sell for less OR if there are less buyers than sellers, price moves down. These are mostly driven by `catalysts` - a positive/negative earnings, black/white swan events, macro events or even a PR ! But these moves do not usually last long so unless you are trying to time the market, its very difficult to win most of the time.
I would mostly like to focus on two things on this DD - why WISH is down? and if it can recover.
‚Äã
Why WISH is down so much?
Sector rotation:
The short answer is sector rotation - BIG money going elsewhere. It's just not WISH, the whole growth small cap sector is down big time. And there are some add-ons to it - SPAC/new IPOs are further down, e-commerce sector is further down, growth are hammered, companies having China ties are further down. Just look at one year chart of these companies for example - STNE (Warren buffet is an investor), BABA (Charlie Munger), CLOV/OPEN (Chamath); TDOC, CRSP (Cathie Wood) even PayPal and SQ are down big time. Remember February last year? It doesn't take much time to move them back up if BIG money flows back in :)
‚Äã
Macro events:
Chinese govt crackdown on tech companies- BABA, DIDI,BAIDU and whole Chinese tech. This negatively effected WISH as well.
Reopening of economy drove consumers to stores and it made the 2nd quarter look bad. All e-commerce revenue is down including ETSY and AMZN not just WISH.
Apple changed privacy policy and it had huge impact on Ad spending (it impacted many growth companies who relied on Ad spending to procure customers) - price went up 2-3 times.
Supply chain issues - specifically goods coming out of China.
Inflation and rising interest fear in the market though it shouldn't effect WISH as it has no debt.
‚Äã
Other WISH specific catalysts:
CFO's departure
BIG investors exit
Slow down (pause) of growth and MAUs down
CEO's leaving
Down trend causing price to go further down - sentiment, margin call, tax harvesting and few others.
Meme tag
‚Äã
And finally some noise:
Negative short articles all over (by shorts)
Lawsuits (mostly fake)
High short selling (by short term traders)
Insiders selling (no real selling - almost all of them are for tax purpose to cover RSU)
‚Äã
Now, can WISH recover?
Absolutely ! Go look at NIO, ETSY, TSLA, AMD and even AMZN - you can find many. It may take some time since there are ton of attractive companies to invest in right now - let's just take BABA for example; I believe it should be trading at 3x today. But I am staying put at WISH because I believe BABA can't 10x and WISH has that potential. Here's why:
‚Äã
Has been built over a period of decade and over $2 billion has been invested in the business (including advertisings) before IPO money. Go look at CrunchBase - there were many rounds of investing and many investors invested over $5b valuation level before 2015. As everybody knows WISH was offered by AMZN and BABA $10 billion in 2015.
500 million plus downloads in Google play store with about 14 millions over 4 star reviews! Over 2.4 million positive reviews on Apple Store, top 5 e-commerce global platform in many countries - Can you believe it? $1 billion enterprise value with $1.2 billion hard cash? Compare that to Aliexpress and other e-commerce platform.
Came from IPO and not SPAC route. When companies go for IPO, due diligence/valuation is little strict compared to SPAC deals as the Banks have to underwrite. It was valued at $24 a share. At the time JPMC and few others have $30 PT for 2021. Business has actually improved a lot since then if we forget growth for a min which is proportionate to Ad spending.
Is a global e-commerce platform and not US only like ETSY, Wayfair, Overstock etc.. It's not cheap to build a global e-commerce platform so there is a significant barrier of entry.
Has its own business segment that no US/Western company has - serving low to middle class value seeking customer base. Since it is global, it has huge potential to penetrate into India, Brazil and African markets as well. Look at Flipcart (India), MercadoLibre (brazil), Jumia (africa) - WISH do not need to win anywhere, just a small slice of cake is more than enough to increase revenue significantly!
Has now built its own logistics business - $1 billion revenue is not a joke! Imagine small merchants being able to ship worldwide effortlessly! Most of the third world countries have copyright issues/fake product issues - they are willing to spend higher if they can buy authentic Nike shoes for example.
Has $1.2 billion in cash and no debt. Over the period of last 6 months I have investigated many companies and I haven't seen any companies in WISH's size to have that much money with no debt AND this level of Revenue ! Inflation and rising interest rates are no problem for WISH. I've read people's concerned about cash burn, but that's going to be stabilized starting this quarter. $1 billion is a lot of money to spend for growth! It can even buy small companies to diversify its business, invest in new technology and even buy it's own share (its highly unlikely for growth companies though). WISH actually has already been working on WISH clips, live shopping and new influencer led businesses. I believe 1Sansome has potential to be a billion dollar business in no time ! Go look at SHEIN -I encourage people to compare SHEIN and 1Sansome website. SHEIN is now a $10 billion dollar business.
Social commerce that WISH is heading into is already more than a $1T business. - https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/social-commerce-the-next-wave-in-online-shopping/
Is promptly acting to align/fix it's business - revamping it's website, introducing video clips/live shopping, fixing merchant/product quality issues, improving shipping time and potentially getting into new business segments - fintech, payment processing, trend shopping etc.
Got the best management in place now. Forget Peter - he was an engineer and not a business person. Google was actually run by Eric Schdmit and was brought in by the founders Surgery and Larry. I recognize the charm about founder led companies but he still does own about 20% of the business so he is vested. In fact, he is the one who brought Jackie in. Peter has become millionaire from billionaire so he has the most vested interest in WISH than any of us! and I encourage people to go read Jackie's employment terms - her major compensation starts when the WISH stock reaches $30! Also most of the higher management is paid in RSU so its in their interest to make the company successful and remain with WISH.
Has the most cost efficient business model - It doesn't need investment in physical warehouse -WISH Local is now just paused but it has huge potential. It's employee efficiency is highest in the industry - just about 1,000 people running the company VS SHEIN with 10,000 employees !
Rising Ad costs are effecting every e-commerce growth companies but WISH's Ad campaign is the most efficient of most of them. In fact Facebook offered $20 million for its Ad algorithm very early on. I've read many posts that WISH Ad campaign is one of the most efficient campaign in Facebook so it would fare better and can remain competitive. They got the best Data science team - look at their patents! It's a data science / AI company as well.
Even though WISH's revenue is decreased and MAU's have decreased, it's still very significant - go compare with ETSY. This quarter is important - if it can become close to EBTDA positive with less Ad spending and still manages to maintain 40M active users and about 1.5B revenue, it's already a lot ! I do not see any issues doubling the revenue if WISH can make those customers happy and increase their LTV - 40 millions of `active` customers are a lot of customers.
Major competitor is Aliexpress but go try buying something from there and try to return an item or settle an issue! You have to deal with the seller first. WISH no question asked - you even keep your item. Also WISH is growing its merchant base all the world - about 50% are now US based.
E-commerce segment is growing fast and would pass $8 trillion by 2025. With fast delivery and last mile delivery solved, traditional competitors like dollar general, five below and even Macy's JCPenny and most will be wiped out or wouldn't be able to compete. WISH should benefit.
‚Äã
Common perceptions:
Selling Chinese products =&gt; It's not even a point - more than 90% products sold all over the world are from China and it's for a reason - its most cheaper to manufacture products there. Most items Amazon sells are made in China. But the point is WISH is trying to create/promote Chinese brands - Assume a Chinese shoes brand that compares with Nike but half the cost.
Selling dildos =&gt; Sex toys are billions of dollar business. I don't see negatives there.
Selling cheap products -=&gt;it's the main business ! Dollar General has $50 billion market cap alone and there are others - dollar tree, five below and even Japanese Daiso.
Selling fraudulent products =&gt; It's not WISH selling them, its the sellers. Could you not post anything on facebook marketplace? I am not saying it's not an issue and I think WISH is working hard to discourage/minimize those sellings.
Float too high for short squeeze =&gt; Look at Nokia; it went up 80% in one day last year - it has 10 times the float of WISH.
Cash burn =&gt; I would like to point out that companies are not usually upfront about investments. For example google categories them under `New bets`. So investment in 1Sansome for example might be hidden under SG&amp;A ! We do not know what else is out there investment/initiative wise.
France ban =&gt; I take that as positive and it will be solved soon. WISH was already working on to fix quality/merchant issues - https://merchant.wish.com/documentation/api/v3/reference#tag/EU-Product-Compliance
Going to zero =&gt; It may go down further but not going to zero. Only companies with debt are in immediate risk of going bankrupt. $1 billion is more than enough to create few startups.
‚Äã
Here are few upcoming catalysts:
New CEO =&gt; Whoever is brought in, his fortune will be tied to WISH. Also whoever it is, it would be far better than Peter business wise.
Fourth Qtr earnings =&gt; Cash burn should stabilize and it should be close to EBTDA positive, if not a surprise profit !
Website revamp =&gt; Hopefully it will fix many issues including having to login ! I also think just a minor fix such as sorting a search results by price, reviews, sales and other metric should drive sales. Right now, I can't sort by specific products that are highest sellers in the category ! Its so dumb :)
Video shopping/Live Streaming =&gt; This is now big in China - look at Pinduoduo and others. Social commerce is the next BIG thing - a next gen QVC.
Potential buyout =&gt; I am personally not interested in buyout but its a possibility if it goes further down.
Wish standard, Wish access, revamped website, quality control, Wish clip and efficient use of marketing dollar should help return to growth.
Also very excited about 1Sansome - I believe its a underdog.
Investors who sold for a loss (tax harvesting) might be returning soon. For example I can't imagine why Jack Morris wouldn't buy back WISH at $3 unless he was not true about his WISH investment before.
I have a feeling we will see Institutional investment reaching back above 80% when the SEC filings come out this quarter. Vanguard now is the 2nd highest investor and its average is about $8.
‚Äã
Add-ons:
- If share price doesn't reach at least $17 by March 2023, Jackie gets 0. In order to fully vest her RSU price has to be at least $35. If the buyout occurs, stock price has to be at least $17 in order for her to make any money. Please note she is full time - https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312521159033/d124710dex991.htm

My frustration is that now after this split, playing the options are not going to be as profitable. Currently, let's say TQQQ is at 150, and QQQ goes up 2%, you see a 6% move in TQQQ or a $9 swing which is great.

wallstreetbet,Hi first post on Reddit but here we go‚Ä¶ I would like to see some honest opinions on the current state of the otc market and without typing stocks you want pumped let‚Äôs have a constructive conversation[removed]
wallstreetbet,"$1500-1747 Price Target for $TSLA using Gordon Growth Model with annualized EBITDA and 100 multiple - With ProofBelow Proof shows that market is valuing Telsa stock (TSLA) using Gordon Growth Model (E1/(r-g)) with annualized EBITDA for last two quarters, and multiple of 100 and the target for current quarter is between $1500-1800. 

Please note multiple of 100 for Tesla makes sense due to unbelievable growth, noting it has 28% delivery growth, which likely translates to 56% EBITDA growth QoQ as Q2 delivery growth was 20% and EBITDA growth was 41%. Using 33% as conservative EBITDA growth and 56% as aggressive.

Q221 - 2b Annualized 8b = $800 PT 
Q321 - 2.8b Annualized 11.2b=$1120 PT
Conservative
Q421 - 3.75b Annualized 15b=$1500 PT
Aggressive
Q421 - 4.37b Annualized 17.47=$1747 PT

Expecting this to rally to between 1500-1747 before next earnings.

If growth continues at current pace, my estimate is we will be looking at close to $2500 price target by end of 2022. 

So stay excited, as this is modeling the way market is behaving. And that is what really matters. 

Remember Amazon has only 10% growth and has multiple of 64.5, so Tesla with annualized 120% should definitely have 100 or higher multiple."

wallstreetbet,"Why TBT is going to 26$+As we know, the economy is starting to pick up pace, employment numbers continue to be strong and we're nearing NAIRU (Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, lowest unemployment rate that can be sustained by the fed without causing inflation). Meanwhile, inflation continues to worry investors. But most of them talk about the impact on equities, thus ignoring the bigger picture. 

The fed has a dual mandate. On one hand, they must provide price stability and achieve maximum employment. These goals don't run against each other in the long-term, but they can in the short-term which is currently the case. At the moment the fed believes inflation will stabilise at a moderate level because fiscal stimulus and supply chain issues stop. But the effects of fiscal policies which were introduced during the pandemic (namely infrastructure bill) will  last for multiple years. There are two reasons for this: 1. There's a well known multiplication effect. 2. The money is spent over multiple years. The effects will be sustained high inflation for the next decade, unless the fed gets ahead of the curve.

To combat inflation, the fed can raise rates. I will not go into the exact mechanism as it's irrelevant for this post. Real yields have never been lower as they're negative rn. the yield for 30y treasuries currently sits at 2% while the 2y is at 0.91%. Last month inflation was 0.5% and higher then expected. If this year inflation stays above 3%, real rates will be negative .25 even if jpowww raises long-term rates by 50% to 3%. The effect of such a rate hike will therefore be unimportant for equities but bond prices will feel the pain: similarly to an option's delta, a bond's sensitivity to yield changes can be measured with its duration. TBT has an expected effective duration of around 37 so if powwow does what everyone says, it should rise by around 33% to 24$. But if people start to realise that inflation will stay for multiple years unless we get positive fucking bond yields, the fed will start to pick up the pace and hike rates by a total of at least 1.25% this year. TBT therefore to 26$+

Buying the market is straightforward: load up in or DCA into an index fund. Super simple.

Now what if you want to a passive, diversified investment vehicle, but want higher returns (and proportionally more risk) than the market? This is much tricker. To begin:

# What‚Äôs a good standard definition of high-risk investing?

* Is investing in TWTR mid-merger high-risk?
* WallStreetBets-style large options bets on volatile stocks?
* Alternative assets with low liquidity that aren‚Äôt exchange-traded?
   * NFTs? Wine? Art?
* Gambling? Prediction markets?
* Investing a large percentage of your capital into assets/strategies/opportunities that you don‚Äôt know enough about?
* Is Shiba Inu high risk investing?
* Inverse Cramer?

The American economist Harry Markowitz first standardized the definition of *risk* in finance, with his Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) in the 1960s. MPT in essence boiled down the returns from any stock into two numbers - the mean return and the variance of returns, the return in each period consisting of the gain (or loss) in price plus any dividends received. Consequently, any portfolio of stocks could then be considered an asset itself based on its mean and variance. Variance is the square of standard deviation, which is synonymous with volatility.

Every asset has an expected mean return and a volatility of returns. You want a higher mean return for a given level of volatility (or lower volatility for a given mean return). So then you want to combine assets together so that the entire *portfolio* of these assets has the highest mean for some volatility, or the lowest volatility for a given mean return. Easy stuff!  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* On the above graph, every dot is a portfolio of assets you can get. The **efficient frontier** is the line that maximizes return / minimizes volatility (different investors are gonna have different preferences, but all investors want to have a portfolio on that line)
* The better portfolios (the ones on that line) are going to be diversified - have a lot of stocks from the market. The best ones are going to have a little bit of every stock. That‚Äôs what **buying the market** is from a statistical, theoretical level
* There‚Äôs **no free lunch.** To make money, you‚Äôll have to risk it in the form of volatility. To make a lot of money, you‚Äôre gonna risk a lot more volatility - that‚Äôs why investing for the long term is such a good idea. It dampens the effect of volatility on you because you‚Äôre not looking to divest any time close to a near-term downturn
* A good way to measure the unit of risk you‚Äôre taking on for every unit of expected return is the **Sharpe Ratio.** Defined as the expected return of a portfolio (over the risk-free rate - aka subtract the short-term Treasury rate from the return of the portfolio) divided by the volatility. The S&amp;P‚Äôs Sharpe cycles around 1.0, so that‚Äôs often deemed the ratio to shoot for when constructing portfolios. Below that is worse, above it is better.

# High risk is then just turning the knob on risk, smart high risk investing is turning up the risk, but staying on the efficient frontier.

Here‚Äôs how some more, [ahem](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-08/how-bill-hwang-of-archegos-capital-lost-20-billion-in-two-days), aggressive funds might turn that knob:

Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Returns) / (Expected Volatility)

Push Sharpe by pushing expected returns up by employing a [little bit of leverage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-08/how-bill-hwang-of-archegos-capital-lost-20-billion-in-two-days). Or, push it up by employing teams of researchers to find the right stocks in traditional equity markets to push expected returns up and volatility down. Seems like a generally good deal - these [stock-pickers are generally not that good though.](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/)

The way you can think about high-risk investing is by maintaining/maximizing Sharpe, turning the knob on *both* the numerator and denominator up:

Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Returns) / (Expected Volatility)

The way you increase expected returns by investing in alternative assets - these are **beta portfolios** of assets that aren‚Äôt traded in traditional exchanges, like digital currency, wine, NFTs, etc - and correspondingly increase the expected volatility due to the smaller market cap of these assets.

So it‚Äôs not free money. It‚Äôs passive, semi-responsible, broad-based portfolios, like S&amp;P ETFs, that increase your expected return by being okay with a lot more volatility. The volatility comes from the lack of establishment of the asset class in the traditional world. Digital currency, NFTs, and wine have a much higher chance of going to zero than asset classes like US stocks, gold, and real estate. You‚Äôre paying for that risk with a higher denominator in the Sharpe ratio. You‚Äôre decreasing that risk, though, by diversifying within that asset class (with a Alternative Total Market index, for example), and across alternative asset classes."

wallstreetbet,"The simple, and effective 10% ruleMany of you may be wondering how to invest during a volatile time such as now. With the daily fluctuations of around +/- 3% it can be very hard and frustrating to deal with the psychological emotions of investing in stocks. 

With over 3,000 stocks to choose from, it can be overwhelming. Well I am going to simplify it for you in the following steps. This is a time tested way of investing dating back thousands of years to the days of Babylon. These rules come directly from the book, ‚ÄúThe Richest Man of Babylon,‚Äù which were found by an archeologist, sketched into stone. This is the ‚Äú10% rule‚Äù but updated in a modern since. Just follow these simple steps to ‚Äústart thy purse to fattening.‚Äù

1. Setup a Roth IRA with a broker. I recommend fidelity but you may have a personal preference.

2. Invest 10% of your earnings each month into Fidelity‚Äôs S&amp;P 500 index, FXAIX. For example, if you make $30,000 per year this would equate to around $250 a month.

3. Repeat this yearly for a max contribution of $6,000 per year.  For those who don‚Äôt know, a Roth IRA is a retirement account that allows you to set aside after-tax income into a savings account. After 59 1/2 years of age, you can withdraw this money tax free.

4. Set back and watch your money grow with compound interest and set your account to reinvest the dividends your earn from FXAIX back into the index. You don‚Äôt touch this money until retirement essentially. In some situations you can withdraw this money without a tax penalty for example when purchasing a home.

It‚Äôs really this simple. No more spending hours evaluating stocks and worrying about day to day fluctuations. Your future self will thank you. If you have any questions, message me directly. I am also happy to help!"

wallstreetbet,"Restoring BBBYHey all,

Below is additional information on BBBY that, I believe, reinforces my assumptions on BBBY's and BABY's value. You can find my original post here (obligatory this is not financial advice):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FWFBThinkTank/comments/udfr1z/bbby\_baby\_spinoff/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FWFBThinkTank/comments/udfr1z/bbby_baby_spinoff/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Like GameStop, RC was actually late to the BBBY party **TOO**. Burry, DFV, Hestia Capital all came before RC in GameStop. Macellum, Legion Partners, and Ancora were all involved with BBBY before RC and actually made significant progress in turning around the business.

For as much as we believe RC is a great investor, he has now come in second place, twice. He didn't identify these investment before others. This isn't a knock on him. He is smart and made some great investments. Also, his vision for GME is by far more grandiose than others.

Since we blindly follow him into any investment, its important to conduct our own DD and estimate returns/values with our own assumptions.

[Also, it took decades for Buffet and Icahn to gain their fame. They also both had some pretty big misses. I think RC needs to understand it takes decades to be a great activist investor. ](https://preview.redd.it/6rc348d9oiy81.jpg?width=781&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e8d129f106325bcb732dadc58ff57db7838059)

Macellum, Legion Partners, and Ancora, were all involved in BBBY back in 2019. This investor group successfully revamped the board, replacing 9 of 12 members, installed a completely new mgmt. team, CEO, and divested several non-core assets.

**Mgmt. Compensation**

This is crazy! Two Chairmen and the CEO received $313m in total compensation while BBBY‚Äôs market cap declined by $8bn.

The Chairman was compensated $63K dollars for personal tax preparation needs in 2017.

The previous CEO lost investor trust by missing guidance for 4yrs straight.

**Acquisitions**

The previous mgmt. and board acquired literally everything. Twice acquiring businesses owned by family of the chairmen of BBBY's board. Do I see nepotism? This nepotism could ironically save BBBY.

BBBY spent over $1bn on 10 acquisitions over the past 20yrs.

**Turnaround Plan**

BBBY‚Äôs BoD

The board has undergone a massive shift in the past two years. From Macellum advocating for new directors to RC‚Äôs 3 new directors, the board is currently 14 people. All three of RC‚Äôs board members are up for vote at the annual meeting. After the annual meeting, the board will decrease to 11 spots from 14.

‚ÄúIn conjunction with the cooperation agreement, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond today announced that Ms. Bowen and Mr. Rosenzweig, will join a four-member Strategy Committee focused on exploring alternatives to unlock greater value from the Company's buybuy BABY banner.‚Äù

The other two members are Sue Gove and Andrea Weiss.

Sue has significant experience as a board member for AutoZone, Conn‚Äôs, and the Fresh Market.

Andrea also has experience in spinoffs from being the Chief Store Officer at L‚ÄôBrands. She was also a board member at Pep Boys, Chico‚Äôs, and O‚ÄôReilly Auto Parts.

Under Sue‚Äôs board service, Autozone divested and acquired multiple assets.

Under Andrea‚Äôs board service O‚ÄôReilly Auto Parts divested and acquired multiple assets.

[ Macellum completely revamped the board. RC added additional pressure with 3 seats. ](https://preview.redd.it/5w5txwtnoiy81.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5219ee1d898aabc18c52aaab177bf3a015891ad7)

Sue Gove, John Fleming, Jeff Kirwan, and Josh Schechter were Macellum‚Äôs nominees and remain on the board. These individuals were selected and have successfully executed Macellum‚Äôs plan of divesting non-core assets. The addition of RC‚Äôs three board members means even more pressure to divest BuyBuy Baby.

Mark Tritton was hired by members of this board to execute the turnaround plan and has successfully divested several assets.

So, the CEO and board were completely overhauled to turn BBBY around. They have executed successfully to a certain extent but are not finished.

RC‚Äôs board additions have put added pressured on Mark to finish executing the plan Macellum put in place.

**After researching BBBY's board members and understanding the evolution of the board, my confidence in BBBY selling BABY has increased.**

**Divestures**

**Cost Plus World Market Analysis**

BBBY acquired CPWM for $561m in Jan 2021 and sold it to Kingswood Capital for $110m in 2021.

277 nationwide stores.

My research suggests CPWM‚Äôs revenue reached between $950m - $1.1bn in 2021.

The P/S multiple was .11x based on sales of $1bn and the $110m EV Kingswood Capital paid to acquire the business.

Below is Macellum‚Äôs estimated EV of each BBBY asset. Let‚Äôs look at how accurate their estimates were.

https://preview.redd.it/hxofdhmqoiy81.jpg?width=1014&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=846913677290e27f3cad4200fa31678bc2b43f4d

https://preview.redd.it/soen0w0roiy81.jpg?width=975&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8586170718c38df62f7a5d88bbc7c94cb1f96c58

Macellum estimated BBBY could generate $1.364bn in proceeds from the sale of Cost Plus, Christmas Tree, buybuy baby, and Personalization Mall. If you remove buybuy baby, you get $661m in proceeds and BBBY generated close to $600m in proceeds from the sales (a little less because of some debt/obligations not acquired). So Macellum wasn‚Äôt far off on the total. They overestimated Cost Plus World Market and under estimated the Christmas Tree Shop.

What does this tell us? Even sophiscated investors can value assets completely different from one another. Macellum believes one value is accurate while Kingswood Capital believes another value is accurate.

RC‚Äôs P/S value of buybuy baby could be completely valid or invalid, it all depends on who you are selling the asset to.

If we used CPWM as a comp to buybuy baby, BABY‚Äôs EV would be $165m. I personally think this is undervaluing BABY but other PE groups might think its accurate.

Assuming a PE firm pays $1.44bn in cash (1x P/S - a fairly reasonable comp), BBBY could use this in a multitude of ways. BBBY currently has $1.1bn of long-term. BBBY has been actively engaged in a share repurchase program.

I believe the sale of BABY would allow BBBY to focus on its core competencies, pay down all long-term debt, renovate stores, and continue their share repurchase program.

https://preview.redd.it/tvjj9kgtoiy81.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eb478a5ddfd3a02ed33d61e7ce8728c97c86a82

I believe BBBY‚Äôs share price would re-rate to $45/share after BABY‚Äôs sale. This is still far below their peer group based on a P/S multiple.

At $45/share this implies and upside of 300%+.

I currently own shares and leaps in BBBY."

1. Bounce from here and go sideways till this year end before we start another bull trend
2. If it dips further and bottom could be around 364+
3. Less chance for this scenario. But if 364 fails,  bottom could be around 315+

Upstart stock plunges 35% after earnings as company cuts outlook

By Emily Bary

(MarketWatch) -- Second-quarter outlook comes up light

Shares of Upstart Holdings Inc. plunged 35% in after-hours trading Monday after the company, which uses artificial intelligence in lending decisions, topped expectations with its most recent results but cut its forecast for the full year.

The company reported first-quarter net income of $32.7 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $10.1 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other expenses, Upstart (UPST) earned 61 a share, up from 22 cents a share a year prior and ahead of the FactSet consensus, which was for 53 cents a share.

Upstart's revenue jumped to $310 million from $121 million, while analysts had been expecting $300 million. The company generated $314 million in fee revenue, up 170% from a year prior, whereas the FactSet consensus was for $287 million.

For the second quarter, Upstart anticipates revenue of $295 million to $305 million, while analysts had been expecting $335 million.

The company also cut its outlook for the full year, as it now expects revenue of roughly $1.25 billion. Its prior forecast was for about $1.4 billion in revenue.

""While this year is shaping up to be a challenging one for the economy, we know the drill and are confident that we can navigate whatever 2022 and beyond might hold,"" Chief Executive Dave Girouard said in a statement.

wallstreetbet,"Could the stock market lose half of its value?It is not out of the realm of possibility that the stock market could lose half its value. If you think that it can't, just got back to 2008. If you are currently invested in speculative growth stocks then you have been feeling the burn lately. Some of these hot tech companies as of late are selling shares for 100x earnings. P/E ratios through the roof. Its crazy.   


Looking at the 20 year chart for the SP500 you can see there is plenty of room to fall. All I can say is, don't put all your eggs in one basket."

wallstreetbet,"Investors are too bearish about the US stock market#The writer is president of Yardeni Research


&gt;In my opinion, investors have turned too pessimistic about the outlook for the US economy and stock market. I don‚Äôt recall so much stock market bearishness in a very long time.


&gt;I think it‚Äôs mostly because the ‚ÄúFed put‚Äù is kaput. The US Federal Reserve has long been expected to step in to bail out markets whenever things get tricky. But now it can no longer be counted on to do so. That‚Äôs because inflation hasn‚Äôt been as serious a problem as it is today since the 1970s.

&gt;The Fed finally acknowledged as much late last year and has increasingly pivoted away from its dovish stance during 2020 and 2021 and started to tighten monetary policy. It is widely expected to have no choice but to raise the benchmark federal funds rate to higher than 2 per cent to subdue inflation. However, the vigilantes in the bond market have already tightened credit conditions significantly.

&gt;The 2-year US Treasury note yield, which tends to lead the federal funds rate, has soared from just 0.16 per cent a year ago to 2.68 per cent on Friday. The 10-year US Treasury bond yield soared from a record low of 0.51 per cent on July 31 last year to 3.13 per cent on Friday. The 30-year mortgage rate jumped from 3.29 per cent at the start of this year to 5.45 per cent last week.
As a result, the Nasdaq fell 24.4 per cent into a bear market from its record high on November 19 to Friday, and the S&amp;P 500 is down 14.0 per cent from its record high on January 3.

&gt;Over this same period, the ratio of the price to forecast earnings of the S&amp;P 500 has fallen from 21.5 to 17.5. That reflects the drop in the S&amp;P 500 index as well as the increase in the expected earnings per share of its constituents.


&gt;That‚Äôs right ‚Äî while investors are reducing the valuation multiple they are willing to pay for consensus earnings, analysts have been raising those very same earnings projections! To some extent, the downward re-rating of the forward PE ratio makes sense since it tends to be inversely correlated with inflation and bond yields, both of which are rising. But it also indicates that investors are much more concerned than industry analysts are that tighter financial conditions will cause a recession.


&gt;I am siding with the analysts even though they are not particularly good at anticipating recessions. On the other hand, investors have been prone to numerous panic attacks since the 2008 financial crisis about imminent recessions that haven‚Äôt occurred.

&gt;On the positive side of the ledger for the outlook, US consumers are in good shape. They are upset about inflation, but the labour market is tight and many employees are quitting jobs for better pay. And consumers have accumulated lots of savings since the start of the pandemic.

Line chart of Rebased  showing Wall Street sell-off has spawned winners and losers this year

&gt;Meanwhile, non-financial corporations have refinanced debts and still have plenty of cash on their balance sheets after raising $2.3tn in the bond market over the past 24 months to the end of March. Past recessions have usually been caused by credit crunches resulting from Fed tightening. I doubt that‚Äôs likely now with M2 money supply exceeding its pre-pandemic trend by $3tn currently. I expect inflation will peak this summer between 6-7 per cent and fall to 3-4 per cent next year without a recession. Consumer durable goods inflation has been especially hot over the past year and is likely to cool over the year ahead as pent-up demand has largely been satiated. Supply chain disruptions should also abate.

&gt;Most of the drop in the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs valuation multiple so far this year has been attributable to eight mega-cap stocks ‚Äî Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and Tesla. Currently, they account for 23 per cent of the market capitalisation of the index. Their collective forward PE ratio soared during the first year of the pandemic to about 35.0, and stayed around there last year. It is now down to 25.

&gt;On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector has been a significant outperformer this year. There have also been opportunities to make money in ‚Äúeconomic reopening‚Äù trades as investors reduced their bets on consumer goods and increased their positions in consumer services. Financials, especially insurance-related ones, have also done well. Another winning group of industries are ones related to food production and retailing. There are lots of good opportunities to buy stocks in the sectors that have underperformed so far this year.

&gt;The bottom line is that I am in the correction camp for now. I expect to see the S&amp;P 500 in record high territory again next year. Contributing to that bullish outlook is the strong dollar, which suggests that global investors see the US as a haven in our turbulent world."

wallstreetbet,"Listen up chumps. The market is BULLISH.Keep it simple. Inflation was predictable and long accounted for since the fed has operated throughout the covid pandemic. 

The premise is simple. Dealing with inflation is easier than dealing with the unknowns of a global pandemic - so float the economy until more information was available to pivot and curve the damage that lockdowns have caused.

Supply chains? Inflation? War? All of that is historically predictable. The world today is not the same as the world of 50 and 100 years ago. The level of sinister actors is lower as we all depend kn one another more on the global stage. 

Inflation will be dealt with. Supply chains will solve and enter a period of processes improved by Industry 4.0 and cloud adoption. Throughout the pandemic we saw:

1. NAFTA reworked with USMCA
2. Infrastructure bill
3. Semiconductor bill
4. The rise of the first major industry 4.0 player (Tesla)
5. The rise of financial technology
6. The rise of education technology
7. Mass improvements in communications technology
8. The digital transformation (cloud computing)




These dips and corrections are fundamentally healthy. Excess speculation is being trimmed. Attitudes are being returned to reality - but once this settles, the market will experience a level of optimization and improvements that it has not experienced before."

wallstreetbet,"Okay fellow degens, it is now our historic moment to Declare our Independence to the UN as a Soverign Tard-NationHear me out.

This sub now has 11.8 million smooth brains, each more tarded than the next. We're more populous than a lot of countries (Iceland 350K citizens wtf?).

I was told by a confidential source in the Kremlin that Putin is in urgent need of funds and is willing to quickly sell us a large chunk of the Donetsk. I say we buy the land and build ourselves a unique and Glorious Tard-Nation, where our children will not know what a bear market is, for they will forever be draped in bullishness from the baby crib to the grave.  


[Circa 2022 - The signing of the Retardstitution by the smooth-brain Confederates](https://preview.redd.it/1sal627xp6o81.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73d3c63b221610535370bc9c3d1c555451b8a18c)

  
I have come up with some working ideas for our Constitution:

* Stonks must only go up
* The ""Sell"" button is permanently disabled
* One can only Buy assets or donate them to the next tard of kin
* Anyone caught in any shape or form of bearish activity is de facto deemed a threat to National Security (bears r fukt)
* A China-style social credit system, where you lose points if you have savings rather than yeeting FDs
* Every adult receives a Tesla
* Every newly formed family is gifted a house (courtesy of our very solvent partner Evergrande)
* Every new born is gifted 100 long-term TQQQ LEAPS for max leverage
* AMC has exclusive Gold mining rights
* Wendy's restaurants on every corner for maximum employment
* No taxes on citizens
* Government Budget is secured every year by using risk-free Box Spreads.

My economic models project a GDP YoY growth of 69.420% for eternity, making us a global superpower in about 10 years.

  
Now for this to work we need the most brilliant and competent minds to run the country.  


Thus, I have approached a list of potential Cabinet Members :

* Martin Shkreli as Secretary of Health
* Elizabeth Holmes as Secretary of Innovation
* Bill Hwang as Secretary of Budget and Treasury
* The Gourd futures trader as Secretary of Agriculture and Food Security
* That indian soldier who accidentally shot a rocket inside Pakistan as Head of the Armed Forces and Nuclear Equipment
* Nancy Pelosi as head of the Department for Ethical Business and Anti-Corruption
* That guy who gambled 200K of gram-gram money as Secretary of the Well-Being of Senior Citizens
* u/1R0NYMAN as permanent Chairman of the Central Bank
* Trevor Milton as Secretary of Transportation (he told me we must absolutely build downhill cities for some reason)

Now I officially call on you my fellow degens on this Historic Day to unite and build a Glorious unrivaled WSB Tard-Nation with unlimited funds.  
Can it possibly go tits up, you might ask? Not a chance. I have it on good Scientific authority by the renowned Jim Lahey that when you assemble so much retardness in the same place, the shit-winds naturally reverse their course and only Great things can happen.

  
Sincerly yours,

wallstreetbet,"Loss porn is what this sub is all about, it is literally in the nameTo all the retards who joined after the memestock surge, this subreddit was always about BETTING money, not on fucking investing. 

It‚Äôs called wallstreetBETS because we PLACE BETS. Some bets make sense, while other bets are completely retarded but still end up making money somehow. 

People complaining about loss porn, well look at the fucking SPY graph. Since 2020 it only went up and everyone thought they were geniuses in the insane bull run. In 2022, the market was bound to correct which meant there were more people LOSING money than gaining money (since most people pre 2022 were bulls). So OBVIOUSLY you would see MORE loss porn. 

Market do bad == mostly losses but bears make $

Market do good == gainporn posts but bears r fuk

What the fuck are people crying about. If that 19 YO would have made 50M from his dead granny money, ya‚Äôll would have been getting a tattoo of his username. His BET was 50-50 and he lost. 

I see posts about how ‚Äúpeople made money on old wallstreetbets‚Äù well I was in old wallstreetbets and we were always fucking retarded. 

I used to see DeepFuckingValue posts and considered him to be the dumbest mf in the planet. (However he was playing 7D chess while I was on tic tac toe). Ya‚Äôll act like he hadn‚Äôt lost thousands of dollars on his BET on GME before it actually took off. For a while I even pitied him because I thought he was a legit bagholder like you palantards. If in an alternate reality, GME would have fallen instead of rising, DFV would be a laughing stock instead of a god. He knew his risks, and he placed a BET, and WON bigly.

Don‚Äôt be a fuckwit. Gamble away only not your own funds. Rope others into potentially disastrous situations that you can't afford and royally fuck them over instead.

And my recommendation is applicable to all: it's not extremely hard to walk away when you‚Äôre winning. But markets are all about timing. Be open-minded, flexible, and composed retardedlly and emotionally. The goal is to make money, not lose your own.

China and USA held 7 hour talks today. Many topics were discussed including Ukraine, Chinese Tech Stocks, and trade. There is something going on that we do not fully know. President Xi Jinping has seen how Russia's economy was wrecked. He is up for unprecedented third term and going before the Communist Party Politburo in the near future. The Chinese economy and stock market needs to be strong before he goes before these top bosses otherwise they might not grant him a third tenure. Thus watch for a big pump on Chinese stocks etc.

He is gonna Pamp it and Biden will help. Brother Biden will stop crackdown on Chinese tech stocks on the NASDAQ. In return, China will provide minimal to nil support to Russia. China only believes in transactional relationships and this is probably what went down this morning. 7 hour talk just about the war no! Mark my words!

wallstreetbet,"Confirmation bias.I don't trust the Government has we ""the peasants "" best interest in mind. I trust the media even less so. The past few years have been a steady dose of we know whats best for you, we will take care of you, listen to us. All while we are all taken behind the wood shed.

The fact that the media cannot stop talking about GME is just the biggest red flag for me. Lest we forget people, these peasants, these retail lowlifes, these normies and autists were making money hand over fist, about to create generational wealth, flip the script and change their family tree and they turned it off. Never has that happened before. They literally showed everyone it is rigged. And what has happened since then?

Dare I say the most negative non-stop bashing by the media of a single stock / company I have ever seen. The fact that they constantly talk about it, cover it all day,  make fun of it and you. The fact that they constantly tell you to give up, go home, take the home-run, walk away, just makes me cringe and question. Why do they give it so much coverage? Why o why does thou protest so much?

It is over. Trust us. We know what is best for you. Nothing more to see here. Why wont you people listen to us and just stop buying and walk away!!! We don't want you to get hurt!!! -Sincerely The Media and White Collar Tycoons

Maybe the media does now have our best interest in mind? Or maybe they expected everyone to leave and the music to stop...but some people won't listen.

This means that if GME‚Äôs entire float does get DRS‚Äôd, it gets delisted because a ticker needs 100k shares traded daily minimum to stay listed.

What happens to people short a stock when that stock gets delisted? **They don‚Äôt need to cover.**

Also, it takes around 1-2 weeks to sell shares that have been DRS‚Äôd. Good luck selling on the off chance that it does MOASS.

wallstreetbet,"Where are all those SQQQ and and SPY put YOLOers? I want to see an update.Happened all March 2021, the FUD into April was insane. Gap ups occurred into April on SPY‚Ä¶as a rookie I lost more money on SPY puts than I made during the retail mania. 

Here we go again in 2022. The TA üêª comes out with their analytics and shows a spy put position with some convincing posts. Media has been creating so much fear for this year and you all are falling for it. Yes, the debt ceiling is high and could be an issue‚Ä¶eventually, but to buy 300 strike SPY puts for June/July for 3.3 premium with so much conviction is a really great way to lose all your money. You literally have a better chance putting your Yolos on black. Red if you‚Äôre a üåà üêª. 

Now that WS took most of your money after March of 2021, they are going to run this market up to insane highs. Afterwards, it‚Äôll go up even more while you‚Äôre still buying puts. The market doesn‚Äôt crash when there is a bunch of people throwing money at it with nowhere else to put it. If it does dip you‚Äôre wont even be quick enough to sell it before the IV takes you out because your too busy reading the CNN headlines. 

TLDR: stocks only go up and long üêª are the most over confident retards here. 

Since I posted this it‚Äôs probably a good time to buy puts now."
wallstreetbet,"Time to buy ChinaChinese stocks listed in the US have faced every headwind in the past few years. To name a few:

1) Extremely stringent domestic covid policy  
2) Threat of delisting on US-based exchanges due to non-compliance with audit/reporting  
3) Pressure from the latest correction in US market

What we're left with is a pile of stocks that have fallen in value by around 45-65%, but many of these are good companies in the near-future's largest economy in the world. We're starting to see some of these trends that have suppressed China's economy(which was in hyper-growth) begin to diminish. 

The largest catalyst being that covid is evolving into a much more contagious, albeit less dangerous virus. Just recently we saw California remove most covid restrictions in response to evidence of this. Obviously, we also saw China lock-down entire regions over like 10k cases recently as well -- so not exactly out of the woods yet -- but China is almost certainly going to ease into less draconian covid policy as the virus continues to resolve. 

On the delisting front, things are reaching a fever point: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/as-chinese-stocks-surge-u-s-signals-hard-line-on-delistings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/as-chinese-stocks-surge-u-s-signals-hard-line-on-delistings)  
We know the market hates uncertainty. Now people in charge of this matter are being forced to address it or face the consequences. It is sensible given the strong economic interdependency of the US and China that the two nations will come to a compromise on this issue so that we can move forward together for the best. Evidence of China's lack of clear retarded ideation is seen in their 

1) Longstanding restraint on the Taiwan issue.   
2) Controlled and predictable return of HK area to the mainland as outlined in their agreement.  
3) Their response to Ukraine was strategically neutral, so as not to anger their unhinged neighbor nor the West.

Because China actively avoids self-harm, I believe going forward they have the willingness to resolve this issue.

Lastly, on the correction in US markets we are seeing multiple catalysts drag us higher. I'm not calling the bottom but there is technical evidence for the bottom as well as environment/narrative-based:

1) Clarity and actualization have been reached on interest rate hikes.  
2) Domestic covid restrictions are now no longer affecting the US market in a significant way -- airlines have reported the surge in travel demand with record sales above pre-covid levels.  
3) Experts on the war in Ukraine say Russia doesn't have resources to continue the war for more than a few more weeks. We can also see that they have not hit their military objectives and have no conventional way to do so at this point. So what they are now doing is terrorizing the country to gain leverage for a favorable diplomatic solution.  This shouldn't last much longer. 

Taking the above into account, China's economy is poised to return to hyper-growth. So if you take the time to compare what is a better investment for the next 5-10 years or even 5-10 months, you may find that certain stocks in foreign markets WILL become the next Tesla, the next Amazon, even the next Apple.  

Thank you for taking the time to read to my bullshit(but it's good bullshit).

wallstreetbet,Morning of End of 2nd Week Trading
wallstreetbet,"TSLA is a ü¶Ñ amidst a sea of donkeysI am going to give my reasoning for why Tesla might not be as overvalued as you think, and may be even undervalued. 

And just to make the bears happy... I'm gonna value Tesla as purely an automotive company. Thats right, no solar, no energy, no AI FSD, no Tesla Sex Bots, no Tesla AGI. Just car manufacturing. You happy now? 

In order to do this lets estimate Tesla's produciton for this year. I believe 1.65Million is certainly possible this year and mainly hinges on how fast Berlin and Austin can ramp. That would be about 600k from Fremont, 900k from Shanghi, and 75k each from Berlin and Austin. Yall can go back to Elon's tweets and guiadnace from Tesla's earnigns calls if you disagree. 

Assuming the average selling price for a Tesla is about 55k. that means Tesla would rake in 90.75B dollars in revenue. Last year form  Q4 2020 to Q4 2021 Tesla grewt their operating margin from 5.4 to 14.7%. However, their opertating marign growth will proabbly be supresed a little this year from ramping up their two new factories so I am going to put their operating mragin at 18% this year even though it will prbably be higher in Q4 and lower in Q1. With 90.75B in revenue and an 18% operating margin this leaves Tesla with a profit of 16.34B. At Tesla's current market cap of 926B that leaves them with a forward PE of 56.68 if you use these projected 22 full year numbers. Down from the 182 they are at right now. 

Lets project what their PE ratio might be at the end of Q4 22 though. I believe Tesla has a reasonable chance at producing 500k vehicles in Q4 22 alone. Once more at an avg 55K price tag per car thats 27.5B in earnigns and 5.5B in profit if you use an operating margin of 20%. If you annualize that you would get a PE ratio of 42. While that certainly still isn't a low PE ratio, when was the last time other notable companies that people love had these PE ratios? Amazon currently has a PE ratio of 49. Apple had a PE ratio of 40 during the end of 2020. Google had a PE ratio above 40 back in 2017-18. What a mistake it would have been owning those caompnies back then... 

Tesla will contiue to execute and will strengthen their lead in the short term. They continue to show they can raise prices and margins while still selling every vehicle they make, and before to long Tesla will be known for their manufacturing prowess. Tesla will deepen its existing moats this year and run circles around everything else. Go ahead give me the downvotes, this is practicly community service at this point. 

Posistions since yall seem to love those here: Tesla obv and no this is not financial advice just try to fire up your grey matter for a second at least."

wallstreetbet,"SX Network Analysis - De-risked moon potential (Protocol earnings, real users, and catalysts upcoming, on Polygon)Listen up degen apes, cause you aren‚Äôt going to want to miss this one.

All of y‚Äôall are buying these 25x-50x potential moon shoots on pure potential. Cause they normally have nothing when they have that 50x potential.

But what if I told there is a project that has been building for 4 years, generates $400k a month in protocol revenue and is totally derisked with a recent raise teased. All while still having 25x potential. Is that something you might be interested in?

**Well there is, and it is called SX Network.** [**https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sx-network**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sx-network)

SX Network has two platforms/products that I will break down separately (SportX &amp; SX Blockchain):

# SportX ‚Äì best &amp; biggest prediction market in blockchain

This is their OG product, it‚Äôs a p2p prediction market/betting platform, that launched over 3 years ago and has experienced ridiculous growth.

2019: $4M settled  
2020: $6M settled  
2021: $90M settled  
Jan + feb 2022: $40M settled

This beast is currently deployed on Polygon and [throws off $400k/month](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x577bd40697bf152a0d56dcc424ab834081677565) in USDC + WETH to the $35M SX Treasury.

Yes, this is a real dapp, with real users, a track record and on-chain fees to show for it. Crazy right?

Seeing as SportX is 100% owned by $SX Network Token holders, lets value this.

Let‚Äôs conservatively assume 0% growth for the rest of 2022 (lol), SportX will generate $4.8M in fees for SX Network. A sexy tech business coming off a 1500% growth year would trade at 25-50x earnings multiple. To be conservative let‚Äôs use a 25x earning multiple but use whatever figure you want I am just random dude on the internet, don‚Äôt listen to me.

So, $4.8M x 25x = $120M value

SX Network currently has a circulating supply of 90M and a price of $0.35, but we will get to that later.

# SX Network Blockchain ‚Äì The literal name sake and why it has MOON potential

About 9 months ago $SX rebranded from SportX to SX Network because they are building a blockchain. Yes, a fucking blockchain. Not just any blockchain, but the first layer 2 blockchain on top of Polygon, which makes it the first layer 3 blockchain in the world (Polygon is a layer 2 for those struggling to keep up).

The chain is set to launch in the next 1-2 months according to discussion in their discord, and boy are EVM blockchains valuable (EVM means it can use metamask and tokens like USDC, USDT, WETH, etc).

Literally all the EVM chains in the world are $1B+ in market cap or close to it, think Polygon, AVAX, Near, Fantom, BSC, and Aurora. SX Network will be joining that club in 2022. The $SX token will be used to as a gas fee token like all blockchain tokens, along with the governance token of the rapidly growing treasury.

Why are EVM blockchains so valuable? Thanks for asking. Because blockspace is so so HOT, every dapp being built in the world needs it and there isn‚Äôt enough of it available. It‚Äôs like selling water in the desert.

Seems like us apes aren‚Äôt the only ones catching on to SX Network‚Ä¶ project lead Andrew Young let slip on their latest monthly call that they have a raise announcement coming soon. Considering the timing of the blockchain announcement 9 months ago, and the multi month raise process with VCs I expect that some big VC firms are betting on the success of the blockchain launch too.

# Okay, okay, Show me the numbers magic man

**Circulating supply Now:**  
50M staked (2 month lock up when unstaking)  
40M free floating  
90M total = $31.5M circulating market cap

100M SX locked in community treasury (can only be released by majority vote to fund growth programs)

**Supply in 3 years when vest complete:**

Max 500M circulating  
Unknown % will be staked and locked up  
Unknown % will be locked up in validator nodes  
Unknown % will be burn through transaction fees

Basically, the circulating supply will be 500M less whatever the above three things add up to. My guess is it will be between 200-300M tokens circulating, but again I could be a 12 year old sheep herder with a smart phone for all you know.

Also after the 3 years, the community treasury will have 500M SX in it (the max it will ever have). Meaning if SX takes off the way I think it will, they could have a multiple billion-dollar war chest to fund growth. Neat.

# Why does this all matter and how to play it?

**Short-term trade thesis:**  
Buy before chain launch (and raise announcement) and allow the market to price both of those things in. Some pretty nice catalyst. Sell after the news and chain launch. Make money.

**Long-term investment thesis:**  
*Assumption: 2025 estimated circulating supply: 300M tokens*

SportX valuation scenarios based on 2025 earnings (been averaging 10% MoM growth for last 3 years):

Very low Growth: $6.65M Value at 15x earnings = $100M

Low Growth: $8.64M Value at 15x earnings = $130M

Mid Growth: $16.87M Value at 15x earnings = $250M

Assuming the blockchain totally fails and is worthless, SportX alone, will be worth roughly $0.43 using a low growth scenario.

Downside scenario: $0.43 (Very low SportX growth and blockchain is worthless)

Blockchains are more complicated to predict the value of, and frankly this post is already getting long, but look at the value of EVM chains with any level of adoption. $1B to $10B is the norm.

Assume SX will be a below average chain in terms of adoption (just to be conservative), that would value the chain around $2B. Combine that with strong continued growth of SportX and you are looking at a $2.25B token with 300M circulating supply.

Target price: $8.00 (Moderate SportX growth and chain is below average successful)

Now let‚Äôs say blockchains take off and gain global adoption over the next five years. Which would lead to massive growth in SportX and the value of the blockchain. In that case the figures get massive. We are talking $30-$50 per SX.

I am a bullish Ape and you should be to.

# TD;DR

**Current price: $0.35**  
**Lowest price target : $0.43**  
**Target Price: $8.33**  
**Moon potential: $30+**

If you agree with this report, you can buy on SushiSwap-Polygon, bitfinex, or ascendex as that‚Äôs where the liquidity is.

Disclaimer: I bought a lot of SX and staked it cause of all the reasons I wrote above."

wallstreetbet,"German firm trying to buy Russian Gazprom ADR shares @ 0.02 cents.Yeah German wallstreetbets sub had this here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/tgfdhm/gasprom_ausverkauf_2_cent_pro_aktie_sind_das_gebot/

Made me chuckle. Basically telling German retards with Gazprom stocks in their depot that they would buy their shares for 0.02 cents. ""We are not even sure if its lawful, but we gonna make you the offer anyway"".

They probably went short before the war and want to close out their position. 0.02 is still low balling it, since they probably lose that much per month with their open short position in a halt. If they shorted legally, then they need to continue to pay borrow fees at the halted price lol.

Particularly love one of the comments in the German thread:

&gt; Hecken Hass Mail ging soeben raus: Hallo Sie wollen Gesch√§fte mit russischen Firmen machen? Werde Ihre Firma auf die Sanktionsliste setzen lassen und Sie gleichzeitig k√ºrzen. Sie sind so fik

Translation:

&gt; Short hate mail went out: Hello you're doing business with Russian firms? I'll put your company on the sanction list and will short you as well. You're so fucked.

Anyway, last time the Russian stock market was closed for more than a week, it remained closed for 78 years. On top of that, Putin might decide that he wants to confiscate all foreign held shares. That would make shares of the ADR basically worthless. 

Short history lesson:

The Russian stonk market was actually open between 1864 and 1914. Russian stocks advanced more in price than American stocks between 1864 and 1914, but American companies paid larger dividends. But all that didn't matter since they ""temporarily"" closed it due to WW1 and the October revolution. It remained closed for many years.

The stock market started to reemerge in Russia in the end of 1992 as a result of a large scale voucher privatization program. Afaik old shares (pre-1914) were not honored. Tens of thousands of former state enterprises were transformed into joint stock companies and privatized. A little more than 300 of them are/were public companies with shares traded in the market.

If they take a break from capitalism for the next 74 years again, than they gonna reopen in 2096 lol."

wallstreetbet,"If China Backs Russia And The West Retaliates, U.S. Companies Bottom Line Will Get SlaughteredEveryones biggest excuse for U.S. companies pulling out of Russia en mass is that their economy is pretty tiny outside of energy which is true.

Well, Winnie the Pooh may go full retard and back Russia. This would fucking crush a majority of U.S. companies earnings if so. 

If you haven‚Äôt been paying attention the past 10 years, the West has pretty much been a simp to China. Why? Because it is the capitalists dream as long as you leave the authoritarian regime door closed. Cheap inputs, cheap labor= fat profits. 

Now, corporate executives have made a shit load in bonuses from this short term business focus. But there is no free lunch as they say in Econ if you take the long view. To gain access to the Chinese market and phat profits, one has to sacrifice their first born and all the intellectual property of your product straight to the CCP. Guess what, the CCP also owns all means of production and rights for this intellectual property in mainland China. 

But, if for some event that China pulls closer to Russia challenging the U.S. and the U.S. tries to flex massive sanctions on China. It is very likely that China fucking cans all the American enterprise, siphoning off all profit and means of production.

For example, if Shenzen was completely shut off from the West it would be fucking catastrophic. Literally everything tech related is produced there, if a binary event like that took place American companies, even juggernauts like Apple, would be caught with their dick in their hands.

An unstoppable force is moving head long into an immovable object.

Positions/my opinion

Musk stands to lose the absolute most if this were to happen. A majority of Teslas profitability relies on Chinese production. Holding a bunch of 2024 200 strike puts.

But this can be extrapolated to literally any American company with too many eggs in the China basket.

(Visit if feeling nostalgic:[ https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld1wio/i\_probably\_should\_have\_sold\_if\_i\_was\_a\_pussy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld1wio/i_probably_should_have_sold_if_i_was_a_pussy/)) I have since been freely living the degenerate life in and out of the market all the while looking for and waiting, very patiently waiting for the next big thing.

Now, before I go any further, I know you probably think you've heard it all. Everything is a ""squeeze"" nowadays and you immediately tune out once the term even comes up as it has completely lost its meaning to anything short of pump and dump.

I urge you to drop what you've heard the past year, put every burnt out association with the label 'short squeeze' out of your mind for just one second, and hear me out.

I hereby present to you a ticker that goes by the name of $SST, or System1.

SST (previous ticker TREB) is a de-spac which means it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (Trebia Acquisition Corp) and had the majority of its public float (51,750,000) redeemed upon merger (99% to be exact). As per their 8-K on Feb 2, 2022: ""51,046,892 shares of the 51,750,000 outstanding shares of Trebia Class A Common Stock were redeemed in connection with the Business Combination."" https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-22-025942/

You may have heard of the 'de-spac squeeze' before (which occurs due to retail latching onto the shrinkage and lack of liquidity of the float, 'squeezing' it), or maybe even specifically, IRNT, another de-spac widely publicized on here in September, which then squeezed from $8 - $47.5.

SST has a public float of just 703,108 shares, one of the smallest de-spac floats EVER just after ISPO (256,408 - squeezed from $9 to $108), ANGH (243,000 - $8 to $33.13), EFTR (521,358 - $8 to $40.42), and AGIL (567,373 - $9 to $36.13).

None of the stocks mentioned above, minus IRNT had options.

Now, allow me to introduce the gamma component.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Gamma Squeeze**

IRNT, unlike the others mentioned above, had a post-redemption float much to the higher side, of 1,381,162. The reason IRNT was able to squeeze so high with a relatively large float (compared to its squeeze peers), is in major part due to the gamma factor.

The IRNT options chain had been loaded with thousands upon thousands of OTM calls, and as the price surged, MM's were forced to hedge for these calls, and due to the tiny float, this resulted in an insufficient amount of shares to be found for hedging, creating a snowball effect that 'squeezed' the price higher and higher by desperate MM's trying to find shares for the contracts that were sold.

At its current price of $15.75, SST has 3,609 call contracts in the money, amounting to 360,900 shares (or \~51.3% of the public float) which will need to be hedged for today's expiry. Should the price reach $17.5, that number goes up to 7,927 contracts or 792,700 shares, $20 - 989,000 shares, $22.5 - 1,209,900 shares, and $25 - 2,319,900 shares, or 330% of the publicly available float. 

Now, all of this is not to mention April‚Äôs options chain, though take a peek at what‚Äôs to come if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Short Squeeze**

Now, hopefully you understand gamma, the powerful force that shot IRNT to new highs of a preposterous 400% in just a few days. But if you don't or are not convinced, don't worry, because lo and behold, tis‚Äô but a slice of the pie.

As of the latest official report on March 9th, which is updated bi-weekly by the NYSE/NASDAQ, SST has 1,374,436 shares short.

That gives it approximately 195% short interest and makes it the most shorted stock in the entire market- by a very wide margin. As of today, Mar 18th the cost to borrow is a staggering 260.8%- one of the highest on the market (source:[ iborrowdesk.com/report/sst](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/sst) / IBKR).

You may be wondering how a number so high could even be possible? Let me take you back to the GME days, and introduce or reintroduce to you what you might remember as the 'naked short.' Naked shorting is the action of forcibly short selling without actually being able to find a physical share to borrow account for the vast majority of the recent short volume (see the recent Fails to Deliver in the second half of February [https://fintel.io/sftd/us/sst](https://fintel.io/sftd/us/sst))

&amp;#x200B;

**What Explains This?!**

So now you might be wondering, why? Why would hedge funds, retail or anyone for that matter, short a stock to oblivion like this should they not expect the price to go down drastically. The answer here is most likely twofold; the first being that, in the de-spac cycle, a company files an S-1 shortly after merger which deems certain shares subject to unlock, thereby adding dilution to the float, you can see the lock-up provisions for this ticker on the SEC website if you‚Äôd like. This file must be approved and made effective by the SEC, which typically has an execution time of 2 - 6 weeks. The problem for shorts here is, the SEC currently seems to be massively backlogged and there has not been a de-spac S-1 made effective in months. In the end nobody knows when the next one will occur, it could be imminent, on any given day, or in the case of MVST, another de-spac favorite, a long time, with an S-1 originally filed 6+ months ago with no effect. Now this in and of itself of course does not warrant a 195% short interest, the trade is far too crowded to be profitable, with all of the covering that must occur in the end. The over-leveraging here on the short side is most likely by the fault of the same MM's who have been selling options and are on the line for a lot of shares should the price increase due to hedging. They are likely trying their best to artificially drive the price down to avoid being on the hook for actually delivering the shares of your options contracts all the while pocketing that sweet juicy option premium you paid for.

The Company In And Of Itself

Now before you jump the gun, you might be asking, what am I even investing in? Do I even care? Well I certainly don't recommend building a long term position in this company with the upcoming volatility that should take place but, this company and its underlying financials is not one to scoff at, nor do I recommend you short.

If this is something you really want to take a look at I suggest you read this brilliant DD on the fundamentals and state of growth of the business here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjbtws/system1\_sst\_ready\_to\_pop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjbtws/system1_sst_ready_to_pop/)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I Expect to Happen Here:**

In reality, nobody knows what might happen here as the public float on SST is so small post-redemptions that it should not even technically be allowed to be trading with an options chain as per standard regulations, and we have never seen a setup quite like this before. The majority of the shorts in this trade entered in the low $10's range and it is rumored that they should be forcibly margin called if the price increases to near the $20‚Äôs. On the other hand, call sellers may be forced to hedge as OPEX comes closer and closer, triggering a sudden price increase which will be a catalyst in itself. Whichever is triggered first, is anyone's guess. Yet it is safe to say that once this takes off and the inevitable short and gamma squeeze unfold there is no way of turning back and the rest will be history.

wallstreetbet,"Best performing ETF investment strategies in the current market. This is what's working for me rnWell  fellas, the current macro situation isn‚Äôt looking that great and my  hard-earned portfolio is seeking sanctuary. Is the end of our great bull  market approaching? Are we about to witness the black swan of black swans (ww3)?

I don't have the answers, but I find myself pondering on these very issues every goddamn‚Äô day in recent times.

I‚Äôve decided to take a more strategic approach to ETF  allocations, and as it stands,  this is what‚Äôs working the best for me  right now:

&amp;#x200B;

**Equity Index Rotation**

This  is pretty much a classic 60/40 portfolio with a twist. This symphony  looks at the 5-day cumulative return for the major US indices and  selects the one with the best performance. The strategy rotates among  the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the industrial-led Dow, and the balanced S&amp;P  500.

https://preview.redd.it/jckygqnkf5o81.png?width=3022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ac965fd685b51b781290586dcd3f2125ac12c8

&amp;#x200B;

**Defense**

What  I like the most about this strategy is the minimum volatility, quality,  and yield factors. Ideal if the current macroeconomic situation is to  further deteriorate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Paired Switching Dow and Bonds**

This  strategy switches from holding the Dow to short-term US government  bonds if the Dow has a dip. Then back again to the Dow until the next  dip.

&amp;#x200B;

# üíé Just Look at the Data: GameStop of 2022 will compare with Volkswagen of 2008  ‚úã

From the VW article above, this quote speaks volumes:  ‚ÄúI have hedge fund managers literally in tears on the phone. Nothing prevented the painful losses from being incurred by those short sellers who ended up having to close out their positions at stratospheric price levels.""

Yet, [a recent investigation reveals how the vw short squeeze 'distorted' the stock the market](https://today.ku.edu/2021/11/02/investigation-reveals-how-porsche-vw-short-squeeze-distorted-stock-market).  This implies a measurable level of causality.  So let's look at the 2008 NASDAQ compared with 2008 VW.

&amp;#x200B;

[Prior to the inflection point, NASDAQ began falling hard](https://preview.redd.it/rm3nnzz7wyv81.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8016ccc97a2be841fa5f5893e7faa34c0076648)

TLDR: I think there is a causal relation to the nasdaq falling and the short squeezarooski.  This makes sense, because hedge fund managers have to liquidate other assets to buy to cover GameStop.  So, it doesn't matter what comes first: the chicken or the egg.  They happen together.

Today, the NASDAQ fell 4%, which puts us at the beginning phases of the GameStop squeezarooski of 2022.  This is my strongest academic opinion."

wallstreetbet,"Vlad announces 10% Robinhood layoff Today we made the difficult announcement that we are letting go approximately 9% of our full-time employees. While this decision was necessary, it was not one we undertook lightly, and I‚Äôd like to share our rationale. 

 As you know, throughout 2020 and H1 2021, we went through a period of hyper growth accelerated by several factors including pandemic lockdowns, low interest rates, and fiscal stimulus. We grew net funded accounts from 5M to 22M and revenue from ~$278M in 2019 to over $1.8B in 2021. To meet customer and market demands, we grew our headcount almost 6X from 700 to nearly 3800 in that time period.

This rapid headcount growth has led to some duplicate roles and job functions, and more layers and complexity than are optimal. After carefully considering all these factors, we determined that making these reductions to Robinhood‚Äôs staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers.

While the decision to undertake this action wasn‚Äôt easy, it is a deliberate step to ensure we are able to continue delivering on our strategic goals and furthering our mission to democratize finance. We will continue to accelerate our product momentum through 2022 and will introduce key new products across Brokerage, Crypt0, and Spending/Saving. We will retain and continue to hire exceptional talent in key roles and provide additional learning and career growth opportunities for our employees. And of course, our international expansion efforts will continue to accelerate from here.

Our financial position remains strong with over $6B in cash on our balance sheet. To keep it that way we‚Äôre anticipating and being responsive to changes in the way our customers invest-  especially during this time of global conflict, economic uncertainty, and high inflation. We are also scrutinizing our headcount growth targets, and making sure that we continue to prioritize internal opportunities for automation and operational efficiency that serve our customers.

wallstreetbet,"Mattel Has Held Talks With Buyout Firms**TL;DR**: Mattel Inc. has held talks with private-equity firms including Apollo and L Catterton about a potential sale, as per the WSJ. The talks are at an early stage and may not result in a deal. Mattel had a market capitalization of about $8 billion as of the close of the market Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal - [Mattel](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MAT) Inc. has held talks with private-equity firms about a potential sale, people familiar with the matter said, just a few months after the famed toy company declared its corporate turnaround complete.

Mattel has held informal talks with firms including [Apollo Global Management](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/APO) Inc. and L Catterton, the people said. The talks are at an early stage and may not result in a deal.

If there is one, it would be sizable. Mattel had a market capitalization of about $8 billion as of the close of the market Tuesday. It would add to a recent string of big leveraged buyouts, as private-equity firms look to spend a mountain of cash they have accumulated.

Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said in February that Mattel had completed its turnaround and was ‚Äúnow in growth mode.‚Äù Mattel reported a sales jump of 19% in 2021 and said profits rose. Yet its shares have barely budged over the past year and have done little in the past two decades.

On Mr. Kreiz‚Äôs watch, sales at the maker of Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price toys have stabilized after years of declines and the loss of a key license. The CEO cut a third of its jobs and closed several factories. A former television executive, he also helped to repair Mattel‚Äôs relationships with retailers and Hollywood studios.

In January, the company said it had won the license to produce toys based on [Walt Disney](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS) Co.‚Äôs princess lineup and its blockbuster ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù franchise, wresting the properties back from rival [Hasbro](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HAS) Inc. Mattel Has Held Talks With Buyout Firms

Hasbro has had its own troubles. The maker of Nerf and Monopoly is in the middle of a proxy fight with activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management LLC, which is pushing the company to spin off the unit housing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, called Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, and seeking to replace board members.

In 2017, Hasbro made an unsuccessful takeover offer for its rival.

Mattel is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings Wednesday."
wallstreetbet,Tweeting muskI dont know how the markets and stuff work though seems to me there is just some elaborate plan to use the steak acquired and his social influence to drive share price up to close to the offer price that are contingent on the whole thing being possible. I mean if he has made a deal to buy the company at a certain valuation then go pvt with it. There seems to be no reason he cant unload his 9% on the inflated price before the transaction is completed(using it to facilitate the cash required)? Should we expect to see a rebounding stock price at open; due to after market trades for next few months? Then that also makes me wonder and question are there more elaborate things you can also do to make money if you knows what you are going to do to the price on and after closing each day. Someone dropped a lot of shares after hours today seems to be more than the billion needed to back out of deal.

The stock market is like being on the titantic as a time traveler‚Ä¶ you KNOW its going to crash but theres nothing you can do about it. The bulls only how was for the watch tower (msft and google) to direct us around the ice berg. Except they were drunk af and steered us even more directly into it. Now our only hopes are to prepare the life boats (apple, and amazon). If those 100 year old life boats don‚Äôt keep us afloat we will see the bottom of the ocean (SPY sub 400) very soon.

As you can see we are in a MASSIVE bear channel and we are testing lows we haven‚Äôt seen since beginning on March. I actually am a little surprised by today. Though my pre-market analysis did mention that Monday had the potential to have been a bear market dead cat bounce and that we would continue to drill. Well drill they did and drill I don‚Äôt think they will stop‚Ä¶

I am actually impressed they were able to get this to -2.90% today that‚Äôs hell impressive. We are actually at the bottom of our bear channel on the daily now.

However, with MSFT beating earnings but market not responding very well and Google getting wrecked right now missing their earnings there is VERY little hope that SPY will have the green pre-market it needs

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqzgbu5j8yv81.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2e674e7782e249dbe4ff099641e30271fd3a8

As you can see the only two bull saviors are the bears best friends. QQQ is currently down -1.4% and Spy down -0.56%. I would be shocked to wake up with green especially since it doesn‚Äôt seem like the MSFT or Goog guidance calls really did anything good. 

Daily wise we are going to need to see resistance broken at 416 √† 420 (the major resistance point) and eventually see bulls push for an EOW test of the daily 8ema at 431.83. 

Daily wise the bears tomorrow will look to break through two key supports. First one is at 415.5 (we are already below that now after hours) and then 410. If we break 410 that is the lowest low from the current bear market we are in.   
   
 

We very well MAY see a new lower low. Based off the most recent lows of 420 √† 410 √† 400 is the most natural point we may hit. That also puts us at the lower support line of the huge orange channel we are in. 

The current market environment is not good. I know there are quite a few who look at January and see the massive rally we had or even the massive rally we had in March when we bottomed at 415. But history does not repeat the pass. I mean this week MIGHT be the best time ever to load on some LEAPS but we also very well may see 350-380 end of year. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r0s7wxwk8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c66f604b05607fc0ffbe0d43fd4d8b81b9d6abc0

If you look at the weekly chart and draw a line through the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù price point from 2018 to 2020 it lines up perfectly with the Weekly 200ema which is sitting right at 360.57 right now. I don‚Äôt know if the markets got the balls to do it but damnit we just might fing do it. We just might break down over this next month and see 360. That would essentially negate everything that happened in 2020/2021 and rest the market back on the 2018/2019 bull path. Which is arguable a more normalize bull path and normal market behavior path. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img e94n3pel8yv81...*

Here is zoomed out a little more. I thought January was going to take us to this point but they rallied us. We will see if the markets let this happen of if they rally us again. This may be a SLOW drawn out process where we just bounce up and down the whole way there. 

To be honest until Friday comes and we see Markets react tomorrow intraday and Thursday after hours once Apple and Amazon release we are a little bit in limbo here. Friday will be very interesting time to assess the Weekly and daily update chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple got absolutely destroyed today and its getting wrecked even more after hours right now down 1.21%. I have pretty low hopes in a rally tomorrow BUT we may hit that rubber band point at some point tomorrow. But this is the first candle closed BELOW the 200ema on apple since March. In January it broke below the 200ema for a candle and in march the next candle it rebounded back above. I am not sure if it will this time or not. On a low side Apple could very well see 145 if this channel is correct. We will see how markets react tomorrow to know for sure. And even more importantly end of week we will see where Apple is at. If we close a full candle below the 200ema I think 140 is in play and especially if earnings are bad Thursday night. 

&amp;#x200B;

QQQ actually had an incredibly bearish finish today. It broke and closed below its lowest point from the January and March dips. And is currently sitting well below that at 313. Currently based off the channel its in 313 is the low but overall sub 300 is possible for QQQ. 270 is its weekly 200ema and much like SPY its very possible we could attempt to see that this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zopcxcfn8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3748c788573950b22ab64c9928244a9527a49a1

Believe it or not the VIX is actually still lower than it was in January and February when QQQ/ SPY was at these levels. The VIX was at 37 around those times and we only closed at 33.51 today. 31.5 was a massive hurdle it felt like of the VIX to get over though. At some point this is going to recoil and unwind and whenever that does is when we will get the massive bull run I am just not sure when that will happen. 

The thing is we need something to drop that VIX level and its very possible we will NOT see that until after the FOMC meeting next week. Arguably looking at the VIX candles now vs the last three months the run up in the VIX is way more extreme then it was any of the other times. Even January was a nice steady climb. The VIX just did a massive move up the last 4 trading days. Yes yesterday did fall some but all of that and some were made up for today. 35 to 36.5 are the next VIX levels which I would be shocked not to see after all these after hours BS. 

The one thing that I will caveat all of everything I just said in this post and about how bearish I am is that the VIX is our guide. With the VIX at the current level it is at, yes it CAN go higher to say 40, BUT it is VERY unlikely we will see that kind of level without some sort of nuclear war fall out, 2nd pandemic, feds gonna do a hike of 150bps sort of thing the VIX is going to unwind very soon here. And when it does SPY is going to sky rocket. We may have to wait till next week after FOMC but its gonna happen. Its just a matter of time. The question is how long will people wait? 

The other thing to think about it how we are not approaching ‚Äúfire sale‚Äù territory where algos, joe blow, and everyone else is going to see the markets and say well damn this is the buying opportunity of my life time‚Ä¶ I missed the one in January I wont miss this one sort of mentality is gonna start popping up soon.

wallstreetbet,"Twitter deal can still fall throughhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/elon-musk-will-owe-twitter-1-billion-if-he-cant-secure-financing.html

Twitter will owe Elon Musk a break-up fee if his deal to buy the company and take it private falls through.

But if Musk can‚Äôt get a loan to buy Twitter, he owes it $1 billion.

The board agreed to a $44 billion deal with Musk announced Monday.

Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, could be required to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1 billion, under some circumstances, such as if Musk fails to secure enough debt funding to complete his $44 billion deal to buy the company, according to a new SEC filing.

From the filing (Parent refers to the special corporation Musk created to buy Twitter):

As described above, if the conditions to Parent‚Äôs and Acquisition Sub‚Äôs obligations to complete the Merger are satisfied and Parent fails to consummate the Merger as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including because the equity, debt and/or margin loan financing is not funded, Parent will be required to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1.0 billion.

On the other hand, Twitter will owe Elon Musk a $1 billion break-up fee should it fall through because it found a competing offer or if shareholders reject the deal according to the same filing.

Musk offered to buy the company at $54.20 per share and take it private. He‚Äôs said Twitter should operate as a digital public square that is tolerant of different viewpoints."

wallstreetbet,"Arbitrage - TWTR looks juicyWe all know what's happening, Elon is buying TWTR at $54.20 a share. This leaves an interesting situation to make some gains.

TWTR closed today 4/26 at **$49.68**, leaving ***upside*** of **$4.52 or $452 per 100 shares.** 

**Current Position:**

320 shares @ $49.90

10 $40p 5/20 @ $.16 *(hedge)*

**The Plan:** 

I consider a locked in 7% return to be worth my time. I am accumulating shares anytime they drop below $51 to average down. Each block I will be selling weekly calls against above buyout to gain roughly .5% to 1% weekly on my position.

We are seeing an expected sell off happen, long term holders are leaving because it's simply not worth the drama to wait for 5-10% when you are up +200% already. For traders like us, this leaves room for volatility to play with as the underlying enters the markdown phase. As buy/sell pressure imbalances present themselves, I will *sell* into it. A buyout this large can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months at the minimum, I will base my assumptions this will take the entire 6 months. So that leaves 26 weeks to sell against my positions as I accumulate. 

Once we hit the ""bottom"" and the market capitulates and goes into consolidation, I will buy the remaining shares needed on margin. I believe $46 will be the floor as we saw massive buying last week at that level. If we hit those levels, that leaves a potential upside of **$8.20.** 

**Goal:**

Accumulate 1,000 shares by end of May, sell CC against them until the deal closes. Wake up one morning to $5,200 in profit on top of my premiums sold throughout.

I'm just some dude that loves playing arbitrage situations and IMO this is gonna be a fun one to play. If the deal fails, I will take some pain but my hedge bets will lighten the blow significantly."

wallstreetbet,"You guys are smarter than me. Explain what is going on with twitter, I'm confused.According to multiple news sources Elon musk bought twitter. Keyword ""bought"" which should indicate the deal is a done deal. Meaning the Elon musk now owns twitter, meaning the stock should have gone private. 

I come to find out Elon musk bought twitter does not mean he actually bought it, it means he is in process of buying it. This is not the same thing. This is my first problem. The media is straight up lying to us. 

The stock is being bought for $54.20 meaning as long as you buy below that and the deal goes through, you are guaranteed profit. I also understand that the price is lower than $54.20 because of the risk that the deal does not go through. But today the stock dropped another 4%. What happened? How is there more risk today that the deal isn't going through. What has changed? 

Again I can go ask the media but they all said that Elon bought it, but if he bought it then why is it still trading. Do you see the conundrum I'm in? I am considering buying it since I'll take the free gains from the buyout. I'm just confused as to what's really happening. When is this deal supposed to be finalized? 

Lastly, how likely would I be able to sue the media for any losses incurred on Twitter if the deal doesn't go through and it tanks? From mine and the medias pov, Elon musk bought twitter, so in theory I will be paid $54.20 for my shares. Basically this is riskless profits and if I lose money then I sue the media. Not really serious but also kinda serious. I'm just confused. What the fuck."

Retail brokerage firm [Robinhood](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HOOD) is cutting back staffing levels, citing ‚Äúduplicate roles and job functions‚Äù after rapid expansion last year.

CEO Vlad Tenev made the announcement in a blogpost on Tuesday afternoon. Shares fell more than 4% in extended trading.

‚ÄúWe determined that making these reductions to Robinhood‚Äôs staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers,‚Äù Tenev wrote.

‚ÄúWhile the decision to undertake this action wasn‚Äôt easy, it is a deliberate step to ensure we are able to continue delivering on our strategic goals and furthering our mission to democratize finance.‚Äù

At the same time they allow up to 250,000$ to be deposited a day. Now if you try and make a deposit that you don‚Äôt have the capital to back. Td will either warn you giving you a day or two to fund the account accordingly or put you on margin call forcing you to liquidate ur securities until the funds are straightened out. So hear where my questions come in. Let‚Äôs say you set up a deposit for 200,000k and use it to buy x amount of a particular stock, this stock jumps idk 10% you sell for profit while on margin. Now in the following days the deposit never clears, and you‚Äôre left to give back the ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù money but the action of buying and selling has been recorded, profits have been taken. so does the buyer/seller keep the profits or would you be forced to forfeit that as well?

wallstreetbet,"Market Manipulation by Some Entity Around Vol Spike Yesterday around NoonAs you know, we saw some fireworks yesterday the 24th. Around noon, the S&amp;P was down 3.5%, and the nasdaq was down close to 5%

This tends to happen post opex, especially as hedges roll-over, and with the VIX running at 30%, it was forcing liquidation by institutional longs. This forced liquidation and negative gamma was forcing dealers to go short, leading to the sell-off. I had thought this was going to create an ignition effect similar to late feb 2020, whereby the increasing volatility creates a cycle of forced selling by particularly factor strategies with VIX as an input, creating every increasing VIX and spiraling into a liquidation cascade that resembled the Covid crash.  Everything was looking similar, including the VIX and SPX.

then something strange happened, at almost exactly afternoon noon, some player, I mean really big player stepped into the market and started selling billions and billions of puts.

Spotgamma covered it as well in this video. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzTbKCeKcOk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzTbKCeKcOk)

As a result, VIX was crushed, and this allowed relief and dip buyers to come in, VIX was crushed down back to 30, and the forced liquidation of the factor longs never came. Someone prevented the event liquidation event from happening at a point, we were anywhere close to overbought on the SPX on the RSI. 

https://preview.redd.it/vo0ztogulxd81.png?width=2099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a258f5b7866935537c54aa4167933747ce134a4

 I know of no institutional investor, or hedge funds, even the largest one that have that kind of capital, the largest investment bank prop desks would not be allowed to sell tens, maybe even hundreds of billions into puts and attempt to crush the VIX and prevented what could have been a 1987 crash style event. Notional options that rolled off Jan 21 expiry was somewhere around 1-2 trillion. The hedging/gamma demand by rolling hedges may be in the 30-100 billion range. Clearly normal market makers couldn't supply that much demand, given daily option volumes are around 5-10 billion. So some entity sold close to 10-50 billion worth of puts in a matter of 30 minutes. 

I have no idea what this entity is, but it is clear that they have a big impact on backstopping markets. And for that reason. I've taken off most of my bearish bets. This is just absurd and insane. I am going to be waiting for data in the coming days just to show how crazy this move was."

wallstreetbet,"Biotricity get FDA approvalBiotricity Receives FDA 510(k) Clearance for its Biotres Cardiac Monitoring Device
9:16 AM ET 1/24/22 | Dow Jones

Biotres is designed to continuously record ECG data for early detection of cardiac arrhythmias 

The Biotres addresses the $2 Billion-dollar holter market 

REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 24, 2022 / Biotricity, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, today reported it has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Biotres Cardiac Monitoring Device, a three lead device for ECG and arrhythmia monitoring that is intended for lower risk patients. 

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Biotricity Founder and CEO commented, ""We are extremely proud of this accomplishment and its potential to reshape the future of cardiac prevention and monitoring with this novel platform. With Biotres receiving 510(k) clearance, we now have another option for providing a secondary product for doctors and hospitals to meet their patients' cardiac monitoring needs. Coupled with the recent successful non-dilutive financing, we believe we are well capitalized to execute the expansion of our commercialization efforts."" 

""Biotres, is a holter for low-risk patients and is designed for comfort for long-term wear,"" he added. ""Cardiac disease remains a chronic issue, requiring persistent intervention, monitoring and management and we believe Biotres may provide a critical tool for improving patient lives and reducing costs."" 

Designed to address the current limitations of existing holter monitors technologies, Biotres offers the following feature set: 
   -- 3 Channel Recording - A wearable holter patch device that can provide 
      continuous 3 channel recording of ECG (heart) data. All other known 
      holter patch devices are 1 channel or 2 channels. 
 
   -- Rechargeable Battery - It can be worn continuously for 48 hours, in 
      connectivity mode, before needing to be charged for 1 hour, enabling 
      continuous data collection for extended periods of time without any 
      intervention, a distinction not possible with traditional holter patch 
      solutions. 
 
   -- Wireless Connectivity - Utilizes Bluetooth technology to offload data, 
      reducing the time for diagnoses. Current holter patch solutions can take 
      up to a week before diagnoses are available due to manual data 
      downloading and a lack of connectivity. 
 
   -- User-Friendly Design - Easy to understand and comfortable to wear during 
      regular day-to-day activities. 
 
   -- Modular Design - Designed with the flexibility to support our strategy of 
      adding future features and functionality to the Biotres platform. 
 
   -- Unique Business Model - the design of Biotres enables providers to bill 
      directly, creating a revenue stream with a simplified workflow for 
      providers while reducing risk and diagnostic turnaround time for 
      patients. 

The Biotres not only expands our product portfolio, it opens up a new market and increases Biotricity's Total Addressable Market from $1B to $5.7 Billion and will be widely available for sale starting April 1, 2022 

About Biotricity Inc. 

Biotricity is reforming the healthcare market by bridging the gap in remote monitoring and chronic care management.

wallstreetbet,"How u start your story as a success trader 

I will summarize it as much as possible, I am a Venezuelan who left the country 3 years ago, now I live in Peru.

I worked for 2 years smelting copper, with a bad salary and more than 80 hours a week.

I managed to raise a capital of about $600 in those 2 years (not because I spent but because of the little I earned).

Since May last year until now I managed to turn it into 11.8k$ with a lot of luck and taking advantage of a niche with nft games.

I quit my job (I know it's wrong) but I can't take it anymore, I did my calculations and I have to cover about 6 years of current expenses if nothing happens.

I want to learn trading and I have all day, 24 hours a day to study, I have already read a lot of information, I have seen many videos but I have no clear idea of how to put it into practice by doing backtesting.

I am doing papertrading in tradingview using the replay option, but I don't know if I'm on the right track.

My idea is to do backtesting until my strategy gives me a good % winrate, then do papertrading until I have a better risk management and prove that I am profitable, and then start with very little capital in the market and inject more capital as I continue learning.

I also plan to get a part time job to cover half of my monthly expenses, but I want to do it after I am already trading with little capital.

If you can tell me how you started, and what steps you took it would help me a lot!"

Eventually moved on to the energy industry and became an oil producer.  I know oil companies pretty well.  That being said, I am extremely bullish on oil stocks.  Companies are paying down debt, buying back shares and cutting costs while prices go up.  Dividends are strong.  CAPEX has slowed but that is a positive for long term prices and is better than lower prices with higher production.  However some of these stocks have very high RSI and are way above moving averages heading into earnings.  I would expect a pull back on earnings based on RSI.  My question is...can an RSI stay so high for so long?  Trying to decide to buy calls into earnings or wait for the pull back.  $cvx $oxy $xom"

Using Charle's Schwab data the TTM earnings for Ebay is 2.5B + 2.668B + 2.368B + 2.868B = 10.404B

Shares outstanding is 626M

So 10.404 B / 626 M = 15.9 EPS.

So PE is 58 / 15 = 3.86. How is Charle's Schwab calculating the PE to be 21? I see they also are calculating the EPS to be 3.4. I've seen a couple other websites that are showing the same thing.

wallstreetbet,"SPY- it was a bull trap...When we look at today we ALMOST had a repeat of yesterday... massive 3% dip in the morning... rally to nearly green but this time they flipped the script and saw a small sell off into close. 

Overall IF we are going on the principle of inverse the market then the markets definitely got a lotta dip left. Pretty much all day today all CNBC and the ""experts"" said we reached the bottom. 

We have a MASSIVE week ahead still. FOMC notes release around 2pm, tesla earnings Wednesday and apple friday. 

Overall im still under the bearish leaning for this market. We are far from a too recovery. 

Today market close essentially erased the ""hammer"" candle we had yesterday. Though todays daily almost resembles a doji candle though not quite. 

MSFT by all measures beat earnings however it was NOT received well at all as we are down nearly 6% after hours... 

SPY at time of writing this is also down 1.1%. Vix hovering near 31.2 to close, all major SPY holdings are down and cr*yp*to is down. 

To me it seems like going into tomorrow the market attempted its best to price things in but ultimately this wants to keep pushing lower.

wallstreetbet,"The Freedom of Navigation program and its vital importance to global trade, commerce &amp; the potential implications for investors.Here‚Äôs the full report: [Freedom of Navigation Program, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2947&amp;context=ils)

I‚Äôll elaborate a bit on why I think this is important for investors to be aware of. [According to the OECD, 90% of global travel by volume travels over ocean](https://www.oecd.org/ocean/topics/ocean-shipping/). The global economy relies on the free &amp; open flow of commerce, in a world full of territorial disputes &amp; excessive maritime claims this is not a simple exercise. According to the report excessive maritime claims of 26 nations were challenged via the FON in 2018 alone. 

&gt; The Department of Defense is tasked with securing access to the world‚Äôs oceans in order to retain global freedom of action to maintain international peace and security and to facilitate and enhance global trade and commerce. To counter the proliferation of excessive maritime claims, the United States maintains a Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program to influence nations to either avoid new excessive maritime claims or renounce existing ones.

Just to bring it home a bit, absent a world where commerce/trade can flow freely, many likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford the devices they use to access Reddit. Everyday goods would be less abundant and more expensive, the global economy would be significantly smaller than it is today. Poverty would be much higher. 

Rationale (according to the DOD):

&gt; The FON Program preserves U.S. national interests and global mobility by challenging excessive maritime claims and demonstrating U.S. non-acquiescence in unilateral acts of other States that are designed to re- strict navigation and overflight rights and freedoms of the international com- munity and other lawful uses of the seas related to those rights and freedoms. The FON program underscores U.S. willingness to fly, sail, and operate. 

The report focuses on the implications for the US, since it‚Äôs American funded and underwritten that makes sense. However, I‚Äôd argue the benefits to the world are at par or exceed the benefits to the US (in my opinion). Financing and maintaining a blue water navy capable of operating globally requires a significant amount of resources, skills and sustained commitment from policy makers. The benefits outweigh the costs or they wouldn‚Äôt be doing it, but what if that calculus were to change? I‚Äôll elaborate more below: 

According to the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=false), as a % of GDP, the US is the third least dependent nation globally (behind Cuba &amp; Sudan) on trade. The structure of the current global trading regime also means the US soaks up much of the excess global production as a result of many nations running artificially high trade surpluses (resulting in that huge trade deficit you hear about). It‚Äôs not all negative (cheaper, more abundant goods being a +), but overall it is harmful to the US economy &amp; American workers. The result is artificially inflated employment in nations like Germany, who run a trade surplus close to 6% of GDP (which is only possible as long as everyone else is willing/able to absorb the excess). 

The office of the US trade rep has been giving increased attention to these unbalanced trade relationships and has made clear they‚Äôll take action in the future if nothing changes. So far just bluster, but I‚Äôm of the opinion that will change eventually (assuming the status quo is unaltered). I don‚Äôt believe the nature of the FON program will alter overnight, but I do think it‚Äôs a real possibility that US policy commitment to supporting the existing trading system with its hard power could waiver. Dependence on trade is already low, and has been trending lower in recent years.

If a shift in US policy does occur then it will have significant implications for investors and investment risk around the world. 

Would love to hear everyone else‚Äôs thoughts and perspectives!

For more context here‚Äôs an excellent essay written by economist Michael Pettis: [Giving up use of the U.S. dollar for global trade and reserve accumulation would be very difficult for U.S. adversaries and would require major economic adjustments, though it would be in the best long-term interests of the United States for the global use of the dollar to be more constrained.](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/86878)"

wallstreetbet,"This Carmax competitor has a $LOTZ going for it$LOTZ  how it went down more than a 100% in a little more than 1 year and stands to gain way more than that

**Warning** I am a barely functioning university dropout and should never be trusted on anything, I do not provide any financial advice. I just like the stock and I have a long position in $LOTZ

The business: Carlotz is an innovative used car dealership network with 22 locations in the U.S.A. What differentiates them from any old used car salesman is the ability to consign your vehicle at their dealership, saving sellers the hassle of selling it themselves while being able to get a premium over private sale prices.

The founder‚Äôs goal in creating Carlotz was to offer the best , no-hassle, used car dealership experience all the while offering the best prices possible to their customer. They accomplish that by cutting middlemen and auctions out of the process. They procure the bulk of their inventory by dealing directly with businesses renewing their fleets, buying wholesale from them and selling directly to consumers after that.

The result: the majority of Carlotz‚Äôs locations are rated higher than Carmax on Google Maps and they‚Äôre also able to offer cheaper prices!

Now I know what you‚Äôre wondering, ‚Äúbut my little Zippitito, if Carlotz is so great, WHY THE FUCK HAS IT WENT FROM 12.90$ TO 1.05$ IN 15 FUCKING MONTHS? NOT EVEN 2 YEARS AFTER THEIR IPO!?‚Äù

Alright, now go get yourself a fresh crayon and don‚Äôt even think about getting your tinfoil hat. I won‚Äôt waste your time,

**tldr**: they 100% deserve that drop in price because they fucked up and ***allegedly*** did not disclose the crashing gross profit per unit, which happened when they became logjammed with too much inventory, and thus inflated the gross profit per unit forecast. BUT the board of directors have recently appointed a new CEO, Lev Peker, a new CTO, Eugene Kovshilovsky, both straight from carparts.com and a new president, Ozan Kaya, the ex-CFO &amp; ex-COO at shoprunner.com. They all look real competent and could be the beginning of another crazy turnaround. On top of that, the stock looks like it‚Äôs getting pretty close to the bottom and options are silly cheap.

Now call your wife‚Äôs boyfriend over ‚Äòcause  you‚Äôve got some reading to do to understand the full pitcher. So why the drop? From what I was able to find:

‚Äúbetween December 30, 2020 and May 25, 2021 (...) According to the filed complaint: (1) due to a surge in inventory during the second half of fiscal 2020, CarLotz was experiencing a ""logjam"" resulting in slower processing and higher days to sell; (2) as a result, the Company's gross profit per unit would be negatively impacted; (3) to minimize returns to the corporate vehicle sourcing partner responsible for more than 60% of CarLotz's inventory, the Company was offering aggressive pricing; (4) as a result, CarLotz's gross profit per unit forecast was likely inflated; (5) this Company's corporate vehicle sourcing partner would likely pause consignments to the Company due to market conditions, including increasing wholesale prices; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.‚Äù

This is the template that quite a few (more than 5) lawfirms(ambulance chasers imo) have used to describe the complaints investigated. Latest source:

[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/90130/SHAREHOLDER-ALERT-Levi-Korsinsky-LLP-Notifies-Shareholders-of-CarLotz-Inc.-of-a-Class-Action-Lawsuit-and-a-Lead-Plaintiff-Deadline-of-September-7-2021-LOTZ](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/90130/SHAREHOLDER-ALERT-Levi-Korsinsky-LLP-Notifies-Shareholders-of-CarLotz-Inc.-of-a-Class-Action-Lawsuit-and-a-Lead-Plaintiff-Deadline-of-September-7-2021-LOTZ)

you can lookup Carlotz on that same ‚Üë website to get an idea of what I mean by ambulance chasers (newsfilecorp.com is a pretty good info source btw)

So yeah... that‚Äôs the risk, Carlotz has quite a few lawsuit coming their way. I am not in the least worried about convictions or anything of the sort, these will pretty much all be settled and the execs responsible have already been replaced. The only question in my mind is: How much is it going to cost? Now I don‚Äôt know the answer to that and we probably won‚Äôt know for years, but since this is a quite new and not well known stock, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the majority of burned investors already accepted their losses and moved on.

Here‚Äôs my rosey point-of-view: After looking at their channel on youtube (which you should do) I am convinced that the old execs just fucked up, they literally got too many cars on their hands, couldn‚Äôt move them quick enough and then tried to hide it thinking they could make up the losses with sales volume. No phantom shares or manipulation, just good ol‚Äô human error, plain and simple.

They fucked up on logistics, they had a merchant‚Äôs wet dream and weren‚Äôt able to profit from it                       . That‚Äôs why the board of directors appointed Lev Peker, the ex-CEO of carparts.com, as the new CEO, and Eugene Kovshilovsky, ex-SR VP of software engineering also at carparts.com, as the new CTO. Because you know what‚Äôs harder than keeping track of, and making profits from an inventory of a few thousands vehicles? Keeping track and making profit from an inventory made up of the thousands and thousands of parts that make that vehicle. The board also appointed Ozan Kaya, The ex-CEO and COO at shoprunner.com, to the new position of ‚Äúpresident of consignment-to-retail used vehicle marketplace‚Äù

[https://www.autoremarketing.com/wholesale/carlotz-continues-executive-changes-incoming-president-cto](https://www.autoremarketing.com/wholesale/carlotz-continues-executive-changes-incoming-president-cto)

Numberwise as of today, Carlotz inc. Has a Market Cap of 125.5M, a revenue of 258.53M, gross profits of 10.59M (puke), 191.62M in cash(!) and 40.53M in debt.

All in All, Carlotz Inc. is not going anywhere, and as long as the new hires are able to do a better job than the old execs, it will flourish into a true Carmax competitor! Recessions are not good for much, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that used car salesman are eating well these days..."

At the moment, I do not understand how to avoid this, **but it is also impossible not to fight inflation!**

 1. You can write of debts through a big war, which I could not believe, and now it does not seem such an incredible event anymore

In these eventful times it‚Äôs hard to observe any real trend or swing that one can pickup on and work a 9-5 while letting investments grow ‚Äì so I‚Äôve been sitting cash and just waiting on opportunities to come by, playing the trend whether it‚Äôs energy/agriculture/pharma etc. and not forcing a trade has helped my portfolio immensely and I hope y‚Äôall have also been staying even if not better in these times.

**Before I go into the details, please note that nothing in this post should be considered financial advice so please don‚Äôt treat it as such ‚Äì do your own due diligence, read the news to understand the macroeconomic environment and the Company‚Äôs position in the industry, study their financials as well as reading what others are saying/reviewing to help you make an informed decision before making any investment if you choose to do so.** 

In addition to the disclaimer above, please take note of the below additional circumstances that increase the riskiness of this play.

**This is my third time playing this stock over the last month/month and a half so even though the setup is probably the best it‚Äôs been, the r/r is not at the peak it was over the last couple runs ‚Äì however this is the one time where it‚Äôs consolidating and at the market cap allowed for this subreddit so felt that the info should be out there at the very least **

**Monthly options expiry is this week, and as per Bloomberg [link](https://gyazo.com/a9e1d6bdd32434b57c3e326914d5e187) the S&amp;P 500 has formed a pattern of falling each month around options expiration over the past year, and more often than not it feels (at least anecdotally) that it takes most things with it for a ride. Further complicating matters is the fact that this is a shorter week so the market‚Äôs closed on Friday so there‚Äôs even less time on hand ‚Äì while this can be good in terms of pressure it‚Äôs also not so good in that it narrows the window for the play and reduces the premium on options if y‚Äôall are the kinda folks that buy weekly FDs, which knowing the upstanding risk-averse community there is here idk why I‚Äôm mentioning but yea, just incase**

**There are a number of factors that could potentially increase the float in the short-run, as time goes on their likelihood increases ‚Äì please see the bear case to check the full details**

**Part 2 ‚Äì Catalyst**

**Part 3 ‚Äì Bear Case** 

**Part 4 ‚Äì TL;DR**

**Part 1 ‚Äì Company Overview**

The following is a brief spliced from the Company‚Äôs SEC filings, website, and investor relations presentation.

BigBear.ai helps governments and businesses make the decisions that change markets and define outcomes with AI that‚Äôs smart, composable and enterprise-ready. They‚Äôve been a leader in decision dominance for more than 20 years, operationalizing artificial intelligence and machine learning at scale through its end-to-end data analytics platform. The Company uses its proprietary AI/ML technology to support its customers‚Äô decision-making processes and deliver practical solutions that work in complex, realistic and imperfect data environments.

They source more data and fill in the gaps to help form a full picture of the decision, not limited by a local field of view. With contextual reasoning and a multi-domain approach, their artificial intelligence finds breakthroughs where other models just find data. BigBear.ai‚Äôs composable architecture is agile, trading the single-use nature of most AI projects for an enterprise-wide problem-solving tool. Their AI-powered platform solutions work together as often as they stand alone: Observe (data ingestion and conflation), Orient (composable machine learning at scale), and Dominate (visual anticipatory intelligence and optimization) [link](https://ir.bigbear.ai/).

The Broader AI / ML market is projected to grow at ~40% CAGR over the next 5 years to reach ~410B by 2026, with near term commercial expansion currently underway by the company in the maritime, space, transportation &amp; logistics, energy and retail, with potential for continued commercial expansion in infrastructure, media, and federal civilian.

BigBear.ai's customers, which **include the US Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, the US Federal Government, as well as customers in the commercial sector,** rely on BigBear.ai's high-value software products and technology to analyze information, identify and manage risk, and support mission-critical decision making [link](https://ir.bigbear.ai/news-events/press-releases/detail/29/bigbear-ai-to-showcase-advanced-ai-solutions-for-space).

As may be inferred from their clients, they provide their diverse base of government and commercial customers in the defense, intelligence, and commercial segments with highly customized capabilities including data ingestion, enrichment &amp; processing, full spectrum cyber, artificial intelligence and machine learning, predictive analytics &amp; visualization with compelling product applications in:

* Location Intelligence: Global situational awareness and impact analysis across multiple domains reduces surprises and informs decisions

* Maritime Intelligence: Optimize fleet operations and hinder competition ‚Äì the first step toward total logistics intelligence

* Media Intelligence: ensuring brands understand the drivers of sentiment and act in their best interests

Their platform is battle tested to perform in complex, real time environments, generating critical insights into complex situations where the cost of failure is significant. **Key wins for them in this regard include predicting the Russian invasion of Crimea, detecting fuel smuggling from Libya, and shaping the Iranian engagement strategy through their product that was leveraged by CENTCOM.**

An example of a case study with a U.S. Intelligence Agency illustrates how AI was harnessed to ingest and enrich vast amounts of data to discover, characterize and alert analysts to activities of interest, including real-time global tracking of entities, upselling their product from the original observe into orient and dominate, providing insights into patterns of life of entities, and provided predictive analytics to alert analysts to changes in usage of facilities or changes in behaviors of entities. This led to:

* 110+ years of labor costs saved through use of BigBear.ai

* ~2B photos and videos processed

* 4m predictions per day

* 100x more discoveries than in the last 50 years of manual analysis

They‚Äôve had a string of recent wins including Landmark business analytics contract projected to generate $140M+ in revenue through 2025, contract that advances long-standing relationship with the US Army‚Äôs Directorate of Operations, awarded one of the first contracts from the Air Force Research Lab to support next generation automation of battlefield decision making, entered the second phase of its contract with its largest maritime commercial customer and is preparing for the third phase of the contract, secured two commercial space partnerships, including Multi-year agreement with Virgin Orbit to deploy AI-powered solutions to address and enhance Virgin Orbit‚Äôs next generation space solutions, Joint development agreement with Redwire to establish a space cyber range capability, and working with UAV Factory to develop AI / ML capabilities for unmanned systems for commercial and defense end markets.

**Part 2 ‚Äì Catalyst**

The source for the majority of the information below is the Company‚Äôs S1/A found here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001836981/000119312522093723/d271170ds1a.htm

The Company has 135,566,227 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of April 1, 2022. Of these shares, 11,001,307 public shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (‚ÄúRule 144‚Äù). All of the remaining 124,564,920 outstanding shares (including all 366,533 Private Placement Units and their component shares) are, and any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes will be, restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering.

What led to the initial run up in early march was a relatively unique circumstance in that the Company entered into a series of Forward Share Purchase Agreements with certain investors ‚Äì the Highbridge Investors ~2.5m shares, Tenor Investors ~2.5m shares, and Glazer Investors ~5m shares. Included within the forward purchase agreement is a provision that each of the participants would not redeem their shares and instead would hold the shares for a period of up to three months following the consummation of the Merger, at which time they will have the right to sell the shares to the Company for $10.15 per share. With the date of March 7th (3 months following the consummation of the merger) on the horizon and the stock trading in the $5, it was ‚Äòassumed‚Äô that the companies would be redeeming their ~10m shares and getting the double up of $10.15 and thereby reducing the public float to 1m shares. Late February there was a filing by the Glazer Investors holding 5m ‚Äì indicating that they terminated the forward purchase agreement and sold their shares back ‚Äì but none by the other investors. 

On 31/3 the Company released their annual 10k and on 4/1 an updated S1/A confirming that the other two investor parties did in fact terminate their forward purchase agreement‚Äôs as well, there just weren‚Äôt separate filings for them. The exact clauses from their S1/A:

On February 22, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the Glazer Investors and Meteora Investors to terminate each of their respective forward purchase agreements and redeem the associated shares, which resulted in the Company repurchasing 5.0 million shares for $50,625, or $10.125 per share. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger.

In March 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares from the Highbridge Investors to terminate their respective forward purchase agreements and redeem the associated shares. The Company paid $24,901, or $10.15 per share, to repurchase these shares. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger.

On February 23, 2022, the Tenor Investors exercised their right to sell to the Company approximately 2.5 million shares which constituted all shares held by the Tenor Investors. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased all of these shares using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger.

Therefore between February and March, the Company repurchased 9,952,803 shares of their Common Stock pursuant to several of their Forward Share Purchase Agreements. In their own words 'as a result of these repurchases, the amount of Common Stock trading freely on NYSE may be reduced, which could have a material effect on the liquidity of our Common Stock.' That leaves the tradable float at 1,048,504.

Not only is the float supposedly ~1m, the SI a couple weeks back was ~906k, effectively 90% of the tradable float. That has since decreased to 480k so ‚Äòjust‚Äô ~50% of the tradable float [link](https://gyazo.com/e84c76549b46c794bf776e0dd150ff99), however this was before the big runup a week ago which may have led to more shorts entering since then. Furthermore, the highest number of FTD‚Äôs in the companies are coming up on the T+35 settlement date today, tomorrow and early into next week, with &gt;50% of the tradable float due [link](https://gyazo.com/c2090f44ca6393ada375af422ebb2584). 

The Cost to Borrow is also at an astronomical ~800% and has been steadily climbing, indicating there‚Äôs a significant lack of shares to go around https://iborrowdesk.com/report/bbai. Over the last couple of days there‚Äôs been a significant amount of short activity going around to suppress the price as can be seen here https://gyazo.com/3696a99e85770778197207c2f2508f46. As per /u/Rex1995, ‚ÄòThe top chart shows covering and shorting on a daily basis for the past 6 months. The past two days have seen the highest levels of shorting recorded so far, which explains why the borrow rate on BBAI has been on a moon mission. Given the super high borrow rate and lack of shares to borrow, I think shorts went all in and just used the majority of their ammo. Why now? Well, there could be many reasons, but something to point out is that the option chain for 4/14 is pretty loaded if I recall and this stock ending above 15 by EOD 4/14 wouldn't be great for shorts/MMs‚Äô 

Let‚Äôs also take a look at the option chain for 4/14 real quick, there are currently ~250k shares that have been fully hedged at 10c, but only a third of the 400k shares at 12.5c, given that the underlying is sitting around $12 at the moment, if they go ITM and MM‚Äôs elect to hedge, we could see some pretty rapid price action pretty fast. If we reach a point where the 15cs are itm there‚Äôs probably going to be fireworks ‚Äì 130% of the entire float is sitting on the 15c option chain.

**Part 3 ‚Äì Bear Case** 

No such thing as a free lunch, so a couple of things to keep in mind:

The first would be if the Company can sell the 10m share they received through the termination of the forward purchase agreements onto the public market ‚Äì I don‚Äôt believe this is the case due to the company saying ‚ÄòAs a result of these repurchases, the amount of Common Stock trading freely on NYSE may be reduced, which could have a material effect on the liquidity of our Common Stock,‚Äô as well as the CTB being so high ‚Äì but you never know for certain.

Another would be the cashless redemption of warrants, as per the S/1 A - No public warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current prospectus covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a prospectus covering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days from the Closing, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective prospectus and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective prospectus, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. Personally unsure as to whether the warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis as n/s if they do have an exemption from the securities act.

The financials also weren‚Äôt great as per the latest 10k, the company incurred a net loss of $114.8 million in the fourth quarter and $123.6 million for the year ended 2021, reflective of $61 million of stock-based compensation expense from vesting that occurred upon the merger. While the fact that the stock-based compensation was a one off is good news, the revenue forecast for 2022 is less than in the earlier investor presentation, at Revenue between $175 million and $205 million. Furthermore, they recently completed an acquisition which is suspected to be a cash deal, so even though they had 68.9m cash on hand, there could be a need to raise additional funding in the near-future.

The Company also has 500m shares authorized and ~136m outstanding, indicating they don‚Äôt need shareholder approval to issue additional share capital, although a filing should be in play, so there is always the risk of dilution down the line in addition to the potential dilution from warrants.

The Company uses its proprietary AI/ML technology to support its customers‚Äô decision-making processes and deliver practical solutions that work in complex, realistic and imperfect data environments.

The Company has 135,566,227 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of April 1, 2022. Of these shares, 11,001,307 public shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. Due to a relatively unique circumstance in which the Company into a series of Forward Share Purchase Agreements with certain investors, then terminated those agreements and repurchased 9,952,803 shares of their Common Stock pursuant to several of their Forward Share Purchase Agreements, the tradable float has been left at 1,048,504. In their own words 'as a result of these repurchases, the amount of Common Stock trading freely on NYSE may be reduced, which could have a material effect on the liquidity of our Common Stock.' If correct, we are talking about a tradable float of just $12m.

Current SI is at 480k so ‚Äòjust‚Äô ~50% of the tradable, however this was before the big runup a week ago which may have led to more shorts entering since then. Furthermore, the highest number of FTD‚Äôs in the companies are coming up on the T+35 settlement date today, tomorrow and early into next week, with &gt;50% of the tradable float due. The Cost to Borrow is also at an astronomical ~800% and has been steadily climbing, indicating there‚Äôs a significant lack of shares to go around. The stock is also on restriction today, not that there is much of that to go around.The 4/14 option chain is pretty loaded as well, there are currently ~250k shares that have been fully hedged at 10c, but only a third of the 400k shares at 12.5c, given that the underlying is sitting around $12 at the moment, if they go ITM and MM‚Äôs elect to hedge, we could see some pretty rapid price action pretty fast. If we reach a point where the 15cs are itm there‚Äôs probably going to be fireworks ‚Äì 130% of the entire float is sitting on the 15c option chain.

Position ‚Äì 250 commons, 60 4/14 15c."

Okay retarded retards, I have found the ultimate gamma squeeze play. I was working yesterday and saw a post about $EVTL after I finished working at 5PM. I saw that shit and realized that it was *the perfect setup for a gamma squeeze.* Then I thought to myself, there has to be more plays like this? **I bring to you $ARQQ. Heavily inspired by** [u/epicolvier3](https://www.reddit.com/u/epicolvier3/) **and his $EVTL play.**

$ARQQ otherwise known as Arqit Quantum Inc is a software company that supplies a unique *quantum* encryption Platform-as-a-Service which... **syke nobody gives a shit about what it does.** Let me just get straight into the details:

**MASSIVE OI**[https://imgur.com/YiVF8YP](https://imgur.com/YiVF8YP)

Just like $EVTL, the open interest is INSANE. Thats 600,000 shares!!!! If we close above 15$ (which is a joke, keep reading, were already at \~13.5$), there will be 600,000 shares in the money. Market makers will need to purchase all that! This shit expires in 2 days and I am 99.69% certain of a gamma squeeze. Every time you retards buy a call contract MMs will need to hedge to stay delta neutral and buy 100 shares for every contract so the play here is to buy both shares and options. Both of these will drive the price up causing the inevitable gamma squeeze.

**TRADING VOLUME IS LOW AS HELL**[https://imgur.com/a/lyryA4A](https://imgur.com/a/lyryA4A)

The volume on this yesterday was 161k shares (at a price of 13$ each). That is absolutely peanuts. Why is that important? Literally any buying pressure will make the stock skyrocket. Why do you think you retards arent allowed to trade after hours? Because when the volume is low the price is subject to volatility and you will go cry to your mamma after. In this case, it is in OUR FAVOR because this shit is gonna sky rocket during market hours.

Let me convince you some more. WSB made EVTL get a volume of 18million. Up from 40k (lmfao) from the previous day. A volume of even 1/3rd of this amount will send the calls far far far ITM. Thats 6000+ OI ITM in 2 freaking days. The gamma squeeze will be *huge*. ***ARQQ never even saw more than 3-5million in volume and that was at ATH. This could potentially blow past ATHs of 40$.*** *Yeah, I know...* Also, we don't have shares locked up here, but it doesn't freaking matter, the truth is its the volume that is important. If the volume is low, then the order book is thin, which means price will go up very quickly.

IV is still relatively low so the options are priced in very cheap. **MMs won't know whats about to hit them. If they knew, the IV would be much higher, trust me. ;)** MMs will lose, retail will prevail.

There were people saying on EVTL that going further in the money was risky, but let's be honest even the 10calls were ITM. Many of the options did an easy 10x-22x. Insane. And imagine when we get the gamma squeeze. Right now the options are cheap as hell, you can probably throw in a couple hundred dollars but it will end up hurting the MMs much more since they priced them so low. If you want to be safe, you can buy further out in time or just buy shares, but personally, I think the 4/14 15C will have the most liquidity and increase the most (I am estimating anywhere between 10x-20x from open) .

Also, I don't suggest you guys buy puts on this, IV will eat you alive. Either hop on, or move on. Or you can hate like [u/ComputerTE1](https://www.reddit.com/u/ComputerTE1/) and miss out like he does every single time. Remember, if he comments , it is bullish!

THIS IS A GAMMA SQUEEZE, *not* a short squeeze.

**CHART SETUP**

Chart setup is also very beautiful. We are at the yearly support at around \~12.6$ so we aren't buying near resistance or high prices. Buy low sell high. Average buy price on this is 22.15$. Most people are already underwater, I don't expect any selling pressure at all. Could even be an interesting swing play.

The **kangaroo** is a [marsupial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial) from the family [Macropodidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropodidae) (macropods, meaning ""large foot""). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the [red kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo), as well as the [antilopine kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopine_kangaroo), [eastern grey kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_grey_kangaroo), and [western grey kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_grey_kangaroo).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo#cite_note-MSW3-1) Kangaroos are indigenous to [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent)) and [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea). The Australian government estimates that 42.8¬†million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2¬†million in 2013.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo#cite_note-2)

As with the terms ""[wallaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaroo)"" and ""[wallaby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby)"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly) grouping of species. All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. The largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies"". The term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo#cite_note-Australian_Wildlife-3) There are also the [tree-kangaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-kangaroo), another type of macropod, which inhabit the [tropical rainforests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest) of [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea), far northeastern [Queensland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland) and some of the islands in the region. This kind of kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo#cite_note-4) A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:

* [wallabies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby): head and body length of 45‚Äì105¬†cm and tail length of 33‚Äì75¬†cm; the [dwarf wallaby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_wallaby) (the smallest of all known macropod species) is 46¬†cm long and weighs 1.6¬†kg;
* [tree-kangaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-kangaroo): ranging from [Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumholtz%27s_tree-kangaroo): body and head length of 48‚Äì65¬†cm, tail of 60‚Äì74¬†cm, weight of 7.2¬†kg (16¬†lb) for males and 5.9¬†kg (13¬†lb) for females; to the [grizzled tree-kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzled_tree-kangaroo): length of 75‚Äì90¬†cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8‚Äì15¬†kg (18‚Äì33¬†lb);
* [wallaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaroo): the [black wallaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_wallaroo) (the smallest of the two species) with a tail length of 60‚Äì70¬†cm and weight of 19‚Äì22¬†kg (41.8‚Äì48.5¬†lb) for males and 13¬†kg (28.6¬†lb) for females;
* kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6¬†ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90¬†kg (200¬†lb).

Kangaroos have large, powerful [hind legs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hind_leg), large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head.

So it seems someone is apeing in on the short side, checked the socials in the morning and even more ape'ing yesterday, yet the price is basically flat so seems to be waste of bullets:

The synthetic long price still trading at a 35% discount but it corrected a small tick over night (before it was 36% discount), so options still cheap:

A bit about the 12m warrants. This is the last [S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836981/000119312522093723/d271170ds1a.htm)

Can see that its preliminary so the shares underlying these warrants are not registered, so you can't exercise these warrants for shares. 

Here's a expert from the S1/A

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny34g4p2qat81.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02cfc99bf3b9effdabbcce8319aa73be8b8b4281

So need a S1/Effect for the shares underlying these warrants to be traded as said before, otherwise warrant holders can exercise on a cashless basis if there is some exemption under the securities act. I'm more worried about float at this moment. 

Also,

&gt;Pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our Common Stock or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell his, her or its securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale.

So there is a 6months for a warrant lieu of the SEC/S1. The conditions have not changed throughout BigBearAi run. 

Lastly, it came to my attention that BigBearAi has significant failure-to-delivers, close to 50% of float

Us producer prices rose at their fastest pace in March since records began in 2010, underscoring persistent inflationary pressures at the production level and the risk that they could feed into consumer prices.

The PPI of final demand rose 11.2% in March from a year earlier and 1.4% month-on-month, labor Department data showed Wednesday. The month-on-month increase was also the largest on record, and PPI rose across all categories.

The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had been for a 10.6 per cent year-on-year rise and a 1.1 per cent month-on-month rise.

The data show that in the first full month after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, price pressures in production increased as the conflict led to widespread increases in energy, food and metals prices. In addition, manufacturers and other producers seeking to strike a balance between supply and steady demand face a more difficult situation because of transportation bottlenecks and labor shortages.

The risk is that at least some of the higher input costs for producers will be passed on to consumers as companies try to protect profit margins. Tuesday's report showed consumer prices rose in March by the most since late 1981, driven by higher prices for food, housing and gasoline.

The PPI and CPI reports add to pressure on the Federal Reserve to aggressively raise interest rates.Fed officials have opened the door to a 0.5 percentage point increase in May."
wallstreetbet,"NASA partners with Canoo (GOEV) 

**Justin, TX April 13, 2022** ‚Äì The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has selected Canoo Inc. (Nasdaq: GOEV) a high-tech advanced mobility company to provide Crew Transportation Vehicles (CTVs) for crewed Artemis lunar exploration launches. Canoo will deliver multiple customized all-electric LV models to NASA by June 2023.

üì∑üì∑

*Canoo inspirational rendering of NASA crew transportation vehicles*

‚ÄúWe are honored to transport the Artemis crew to the launch site for the¬†first human lunar landing in more than 50 years. The selection of our innovative technologies by NASA to take a diverse team of American astronauts to the moon showcases a great commitment to sustainable transportation,‚Äù said Canoo Investor, Chairman and CEO Tony Aquila. ‚ÄúAs a high-tech mobility company, we are inspired by NASA‚Äôs pioneering and trailblazing spirit. Our customized vehicles are modular and upgradable throughout their lifecycle with a high level of recyclability at end of life. Canoo‚Äôs Made in America electric vehicles embody our nation‚Äôs ingenuity and bold determination to reclaim global technology leadership for America and its allied nations. We are proud to be a partner to NASA in one of the world‚Äôs greatest endeavors.‚Äù

**Designing with the human in mind:**

The Crew Transportation Vehicle must carry fully suited astronauts, flight support staff and equipment to the launch site. Astronaut and crew comfort, safety and function are critical to successful completion of a mission. Addressing these challenges early on in the design phase speeds development and often results in a better product.

The new Crew Transportation Vehicles will be¬†based on Canoo‚Äôs LV model ‚Äì a future-forward all-electric vehicle, designed from a clean sheet and based on Canoo‚Äôs proprietary multi-purpose platform to maximize cabin space, utility and productivity on a compact footprint.¬†

Canoo vehicles are engineered from the inside out, vertically integrating drive by wire function in its modular multi-purpose platform which liberates valuable interior space for passengers and cargo. The team focused on optimizing function and form, so each component and space of the vehicle has a purpose for the driver, passenger and¬†the mission.¬†

**Powered by innovation:**

Canoo is revolutionizing the way vehicles are built with its multi-purpose platform and interchangeable top hats. The company has filed more than 160 patents spanning across every major component of their vehicles. Taking cues from aerospace, Canoo¬†engineers for the future, the vehicles are fully redundant, harmonized for secure proprietary software and over the air updates. Its focus on IP creation is following the trajectory set forth by NASA's pioneering spirit.¬†

As with spacecraft engineering and design, component serviceability and upgradability are critical to reduce project lifetime cost. Canoo has put an emphasis on designing its vehicles at lower part counts and high level or repairability achieved through a modular approach to design making the vehicles more efficient, durable and sustainable across their lifecycle.¬†

**Built in the heartland:**

Canoo will manufacture vehicles for the Artemis mission in the heartland. The company recently named Bentonville, Arkansas as its headquarters and advanced manufacturing site and Pryor, Oklahoma as the site of its mega micro factory. Canoo will bring more than 2,700 high tech advanced mobility jobs directly and attract many more indirectly to the region. Canoo plans to launch commercial production from its Bentonville facility in late 2022.¬†

‚ÄúThe heartland has produced 7 of America‚Äôs astronauts, including the first¬†Native American astronaut. We are pleased to build on that incredible legacy and to engage the can-do spirit of this dynamic region in the future of space exploration‚Äù Aquila said. ‚ÄúNASA‚Äôs choice will support high-paying technology and light blue collar EV advanced manufacturing jobs with the Cherokee Nation and the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas.""¬†

**A historic mission:**

It has been more than 50 years since the Apollo mission brought the first astronauts to the moon. [Artemis](http://www.nasa.gov/artemis), twin sister to Apollo and goddess of the moon in Greek mythology, is a fitting mission to land the first woman and person of color on the moon and provide learning opportunities for future missions. This seminal mission will establish‚ÄØthe first long-term human and robotic presence on‚ÄØand around‚ÄØthe lunar surface and lay the groundwork for future crewed visits to Mars.

NASA selected Canoo‚Äôs zero emission LVs as the Crew Transport Vehicles for the Artemis Program through a competitive process.¬†

The prices that goods and services producers receive rose in March at the fastest pace since records have been kept, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.

The producer price index, which measures the prices paid by wholesalers, increased 11.2% from a year ago, the most in a data series going back to November 2010. On a monthly basis, the gauge increased 1.4%, above the 1.1% Dow Jones estimate and also a new record.

Stripping out food, energy and trade services, so-called core PPI rose 0.9% on a monthly basis, nearly double the 0.5% estimate and the biggest monthly gain since January 2021. Core PPI increased 7% on a year-over-year basis.

wallstreetbet,"Munger's 50% haircut doesn't mean anythingThe company sold 302,060 Alibaba AdSs in the first quarter, reducing its investment to 300,000 AdSs, according to a Daily Journal filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, Munger cut ali's position by 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a bear market information of underweight, happened countless times in the capital markets, traders may be derived from this name wrong targets; May also be a quarter of extreme stock liquidity, forced deleveraging.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this kind of deal, it couldn't be more common.

&amp;#x200B;

But when it comes to the aura of Munger, Buffett's partner and creator of the fence model, it takes on a different meaning.

&amp;#x200B;

The market showed pessimism, both ""god"" this operation disappointed, after all, before said so much about Ali; There are also dissatisfaction with the status quo of A4 paper in China, as well as the disillusionment that Munger ran away after copying homework.

&amp;#x200B;

Sentiment continues to simmer, with Alibaba's holders calling it a ""catastrophe.""

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, investment is an independent thinking activity, not a key person, important tycoon. Munger's analysis and identification of Ali, read for yourself, does not express any unique perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

But its position ""ass"", decided that many investors think Munger has any significant basis, ""god"" do not say.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually, I see it quite differently, and there is scope for the growth stocks that Munger specializes in. Ali's ticket outside his circle of competence is of little reference value.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, the analysis of Ali, now talk about bottom fishing or directly make a prediction, is obviously against the Internet investment discipline. The following is my detailed analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Munger, who specializes in growth stocks, clearly crossed the line with alibaba

&amp;#x200B;

At various points, Buffett has expressed the origins of his investment approach: from Graham on the one hand, and munger on the other, who helped him complete his ape-to-man evolution.

&amp;#x200B;

This points to munger's approach to investing -- growth stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, we also know very well that Munger's fund in 1971 to 1975, due to the continuous bear market, caused too much retreat, in 75 years after the return of blood, liquidated his fund, lap."

wallstreetbet,"Musk in trouble again? Twitter shareholders sued for delay in disclosing their holdingsOn April 12, a Twitter shareholder filed a lawsuit against Musk, claiming that musk failed to disclose a large purchase of Twitter stock in a timely manner, causing him and other shareholders to suffer financial losses.

&amp;#x200B;

The lawsuit filed in Manhattan, New York, by Marc Bain Rasella, claims Musk started buying large amounts of Twitter stock in January and reached the 5 percent disclosure threshold on March 14. U.S. securities laws require investors to disclose information within 10 days of a transaction if they buy 5 percent or more of a company. That meant Mr Musk was supposed to announce his stake no later than March 24, but he did not do so until April 4.

&amp;#x200B;

On April 4, Musk revealed he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making it the social media platform's largest shareholder. Twitter closed the day up more than 27%."

&amp;#x200B;

The increase in interim earnings was driven by the increase in earnings from the group's hemodialysis business, which amounted to approximately HK $44.386,000, a significant increase of approximately HK $24.366,000 or approximately 121.71% compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the increase in the number of patients treated at the hemodialysis treatment centres.

&amp;#x200B;

The group believes that the demand for hemodialysis services in the Chinese market is still far from being met and there is still great potential for development. Based on the group's experience and strength in the medical field, further exploration and expansion from the existing business to the continuously rising hemodialysis industry will become the driving force for the company to further establish its influence in the market and create better returns for shareholders."

wallstreetbet,"Is the U.S. stock and bond valuation bubble comparable to a bull market? The sell-off may be far from overSince April, stocks and bonds in the U.S. market have experienced a rare coordinated decline, and this situation of double-killing stocks and bonds is still fermenting. The economic cycle is moving forward for stock and bond investors amid the hawks of the Fed, and valuations may finally come into play again.

The S&amp;P 500 has fallen in five of the past six sessions, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen for seven straight days.

While rate hikes are on the market's radar, an equally big issue for bulls is valuation, with years of price appreciation leaving stocks and bonds at very high levels relative to cash.

First, the sum of asset returns is lower than the inflation rate for the first time in 60 years

Jones strading proposes a new way to measure the valuation bubble in stocks and bonds in a report that adds the yield on the S&amp;P 500 and the rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to arrive at the total yield -- which is called the total yield. Called the ""reverse Fed model"". Overall, even with higher bond rates, the current total yield is 7.2%, which is lower than 93% of the time since 1962.

To make matters worse, asset returns themselves are shrinking due to inflation. With the U.S. CPI rising by 8.5% in March, the return on these assets was even lower than the inflation rate for the first time in 60 years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h0oypoc5hat81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56bf21a2a712b28a468038717e57221d514aca8e

""Historically, investors have worked harder to reprice stocks and bonds to ensure that taking extra risk pays off,"" Michael O'rourke, chief market strategist at Jones strading, said in an interview. ""The market believes the Fed will back down at the first signs of weakness in asset prices.""

The S&amp;P 500 is currently yielding 4.4%, one of the lowest in decades. It is worth noting that the yield is just the opposite of the price-earnings ratio, and the higher the yield, the cheaper the stock price. Also, while interest rates on 10-year Treasuries hit a three-year high of 2.78% on Monday, they are currently less than half their historical levels.

Second, the stock and bond valuation bubble is comparable to a bull market

In the ""Inverse Fed Model,"" Jones strading's O'rourke uses a framework based on a July 1997 central bank report that compares the relative values ‚Äã‚Äãof stocks and bonds to determine which is more attractive assets.

To O'rourke, both assets appear to be priced in a bubble, inflated by years of easy monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. To prove his point, he summarizes the yields on U.S. Treasuries and stocks to show how little investors are getting today compared to history.

Ed Yardeni, CEO of Yardeni Research Inc., said the approach is a clever way to present cross-asset valuations. Yardeni said: ""I think this model is a neat interpretation of the valuation of stocks and bonds in the capital markets. It is a useful addition to the ensemble of valuation models.""

Of course, inflation isn't a clear negative for stock investors. U.S. companies have been posting record profits, led by rising stock prices, and if the trend persists, profits could grow to exorbitant multiples. The problem with bubble valuations can be resolved over time.

However, the market may not have the patience to wait. Financial conditions have eased since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March as stocks rebounded. In O'rourke's view, this is a signal that central bankers need to get tough. ""As soon as the market believes the Fed won't budge, assets will likely return to undervalued valuations. The Fed needs to recognize that reality,"" O'Rourke said.

Also, stocks are currently expensive by other metrics. According to data compiled by Strategas Securities, about 17% of Russell 3000 stocks trade at more than 10 times earnings, a ratio even higher than in the dot-com bubble era.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bp3r2ugfhat81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3b5cdbd12b132e162f1a4e26bf243426a66f9dc

Ryan Grabinski, strategist at Strategas, said: ""While it is true that many high-value stocks have fallen sharply, they may have more downside. When the cost of capital is no longer free, how much investors are willing to pay for these speculative stocks. What about money? Not to mention that many of these companies are zero-profit and often need additional capital to support their operations.‚Äù

Third, many well-known investors also ""call out"" that the valuation of US stocks is too high

Many well-known investors have also issued warnings that U.S. stocks are currently overvalued and the sell-off may not be over yet.

Morgan Stanley analyst Mike Wilson said yesterday that the Fed could hit economic growth and stock market valuations appear overvalued. ""The S&amp;P 500 continues to trade at valuations that we have struggled to justify, even though the index is down around 6% this year.""

In addition, ""big bear"" Michael Burry also warned that U.S. stocks are significantly overvalued and prices could plummet.

""It's pretty much a multiplex question,"" Bury tweeted, including a chart that tracks price-to-earnings ratios for the S&amp;P 500 equal-weight index. The chart shows that in the 1990s and most of the 2000s, the ratio was below 1.0, but it has nearly doubled in the past 10 years and is now above 1.9.

Presumably, Burry wants to show that the index is trading at nearly twice its constituents' earnings, suggesting that the valuation multiples of these larger U.S. public companies have reached unsustainable heights.

wallstreetbet,"JPMorgan Profits Drop 42%, Bank Writes off Russian AssetsThe nation's largest bank by assets said it earned a profit of $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share, down from a profit of $14.3 billion, or $4.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results missed the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who were looking for JPMorgan to earn $2.72 a share, according to FactSet.

Much of JPMorgan's profit decline came because, the year before, the bank released more than $4 billion in credit reserves tied to the improving economy and waning COVID-19 pandemic. For more than a year, JPMorgan and other banks had been releasing the funds they had socked away to cover potentially bad loans. Those releases had boosted the bank's profits significantly, but investors knew these one-time bumps in profits were temporary.

Now JPMorgan is going in reverse. The bank set aside $1.46 billion to write off its assets tied to Russia as well as assets that have been negatively exposed to persistently higher inflation. The bank said most of the Russian exposure was in its investment banking division as well as its asset management business. 

""We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term ‚Äì consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels ‚Äì but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,‚Äù said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.

JPMorgan is the first of Wall Street big banks to report their results for the first quarter. Analysts expect Wall Street will report a modest, but noticeable, hit to its profits as banks individually report their exposure to Russia. JPMorgan had a modest business in Russia. Citigroup, which had both an investment bank and a consumer banking business, will report its results on Thursday.

The volatility in markets the first three months of the year due to Russia's invasion as well as inflation also negatively impacted the bank's trading desks. JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank posted a 26% decline in profits from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue and fees dropped sharply, as companies put deals on hold. Stock and bond trading revenues also declined.

wallstreetbet,Mental health care crisis and psilocybin (psychedelics)We‚Äôve witnessed the insane shooting in New York. People have been locked up during the pandemic and I‚Äôve seen a lot of people losing their mind. The inflation is fueling the mental health crisis. Numbers of opioid addiction has been growing substantially and traditional therapies have proven to be too obsolete for a long period of time to a lot of people. Experts are asserting psychedelics could be effective solution to tackle this problem. Moreover psilocybin has a lot of anecdotal evidence for safety and efficacy. What are your opinions on psychedelic stocks? IMO I firmly believe psychedelic is the future of mental health.

wallstreetbet,"Big Five, BigFuckingValue.Please hear me out, my intention is to long term hold big five, boring I know but hear me out. Also don't ban me bro, I'm relatively new to posting on reddit despite having stalked and scoffed at some of the things I've seen on Dota Subreddits and others...

So I'll start: Apologies for the roughness of the story and explanation, I know I suck.

To any who think this is a dead company, I will remind you that other dated companies have reshaped their business model for the better, and increased their margins many times over.

Currently Big Five is a understated gem. Their business mode is simple provide good value to customers by finding good deals, maintaining good supplier relationships, and reduce costs by implementing medium sized stores. 

They supply sports equipment, outdoor equipment, and guns. Like a smaller vastly more affordable Bass Pro. Yes they actually do sell(and service guns in California, they also have shooting ranges, a fair bit of them.

Other companies

They have been at this game since 1955. The largest market that they serve is California.
This means they have served and been entrenched in California and all its gun opposing legistlation, and still manage to turn a profit, and a rather large one compared to their market cap, despite having to compete with Walmart, Dicks Sporting Goods, and Bass Pro.

A gun store in California? (Scoffs haughtily)

Having lived in Southern California(North County San Diego on the border of East County) My family had its roots there in 1955 when it was only farm land, cow towns, and middle of nowhere. 
Its hot, real hot, dry, not great for residential areas, not a lot of water(naturally) but great for cows, and other vast open areas. It is literally a sub desert, turned into suburbia(somewhat).

Apart from the major cities the vast majority of California is Conservative. 

So having grown up there for 30 years of my life and having family that most would say are... country from there I can tell you that a more conservative population exists in not just So-Cal but California as a whole.

The states voting all one way or the other just hides the fact.(neither here nor there. but gives credence to portions of my argument and offers explanations for further explanations of their inexplicable profitibility, just look up voting patterns by regions in california if you are unconvinced.)

So having somewhat of a history living in So-Cal I can tell you for a fact that Big Five basically has zero presence online, as well as is terrible at reaching extended audiences. They have a user interface on their website that looks like it belongs in the 90's. They have no sales app, no commercials, no fancy advertisements, just, no great slogan. In fact compared with the size of their competitors how do they make a profit? 

Its baffling, despite being short sold into the ground and despite dividend payouts, they remain profitable YoY(most of the time), have relatively no debt and own a non-insignificant amount of equity.

Shit despite big brands pulling out they still remain afloat and profitable.

So who else serves sporting goods in California, theres alot and they somewhat have themes.

REI - Yogi Type Muir Themed Outdoors Store (no guns only granola and climbing gear but I go there for climbing gear sometimes) - Big Stores Lotsa Stuff
Serves Higher Income Hippie Customers

Bass Pro - HUGE  Stores, Camping, Guns, Outdoors, Hiking, fishing. Like if REI also sold guns and hunting equipment. (they also have food stuff)
Largely Serves Higher Income Customers

Walmart - Huge Stores, nuff said. Lower income walmarts are... kinda sus and they lock all their higher priority items up, and make you feel unwelcome. But they sell guns!

Costco - No guns.

Dicks Sporting Goods - More an athetic sports store, usually in mid income/higher income neighborhoods. They have weight lifting gear, baseball equipments, soccer etc. No guns, no hunting equipment and no camping eauipment.
Mid to Large Size Stores in mid to higher income neighborhoods.

Big Five Sporting Goods:
Already stated before but I'll add this.
Sporting Goods, Shoes, Sport Wear, And guns. Gives Solid Pricing. Some perceived overlap with Dicks.
Mid to Lower Income Areas.

Given its placement it would largely be perceived as unpopular, and given its size it likely struggles to broker bulk sizing deals with its suppliers but still manages to do so enough to turn a profit. Given its lackluster advertising and brand awareness, it still manages to turn a profit.

Given the size of the store it is well adapted to uniquely serving the more vast rural and lower income areas of California, and smaller store size where stores like Bass Pro are cost prohibitevely expensivez 

In these areas ones choices in these are slim, and even though Big Five feels somewhat old dusty and somewhat antiquated it is largely leaps and bounds beyond the locked up unwelcoming largely distopian feeing of locked up merchandise at walmart, and a marked improvement on the more variable one off firearm retailers. Thus despite lack luster advertising it is a deeply entrenched brand that continues to thrive despite itself not aggressivey pushing to a massive audience.

Despite being short sold into oblivion it still provided a dividend. Despite covid? Same.

In fact with a modernization of its brand name, a catchy ad campain, and a modernized customer user web interface to reach a wider audience it would more than likely dominate a large market share of the entire state and grow far beyond that. 
However its biggest current struggle is somewhat of a lack of vision from its current executive leadership who I feel don't fully recognize their unique position and capacity for aggressive expansion. But understandably this is... not the personal of the company, but that changes with a slight shift in the mindset of the leadership.

At a P/S of under 1 and a P/E of ~4 and forward DCF that suggests the company is trading at a discount(even after its initial squeeze) what can I say I like the stock.
With a low float, a high short percent float of 40%, HTB, and buying back shares, whats there not to like? If so I'm probably to stupid to realize. 
Only problem is that when the stock price goes up people sell out, can't blame you for selling out, but I don't intend to if I can help to. Just plan to slowly accrue shares overtime until I either own it or the company modernizes. Either I'll own Gun/sports store now turned hedge fund or I'll own a large portion of the stake in a large and successful sports and outdoors retailer.

TLDR: 
UnderValued.
This is a value company, not only to their customers but on the market size they represent. This is your grandads boring company.
Would be a Charlie Munger WetDream.
What can I say I like the stock."

wallstreetbet,"Big BEAR warning: U.S. stocks could tumble at any time""It's almost a multiple issue,"" Burry wrote on Twitter (44.48, -2.53, -5.38%). He also included a chart that tracks price-to-earnings ratios for the S&amp;P 500's equally-weighted index. The chart shows that the ratio was below 1.0 for much of the 1990s and 2000s, but has almost doubled in the past decade and is now above 1.9.

Presumably, Burry would like to point out that the index is trading at almost twice the revenue of its constituents -- suggesting that the valuation multiples of America's largest public companies have reached unsustainable heights.

&amp;#x200B;

Burry is best known for his Big bet on the U.S. housing bubble in the mid-2000s, popularized in the book and movie 'The Big Short.' He also invested in GameStop before its stock price soared in January 2021, paving the way for the Meme stock boom. Last year, he also made high-profile bets on Musk's Tesla (986.95, 11.02, 1.13%) and On Ms. Wood's flagship product, the Ark Innovation ETF.

&amp;#x200B;

Burry has repeatedly warned over the past 18 months about overvalued assets and predicted a historic sell-off. Last June, he warned that the market was in the midst of the biggest speculative bubble in history.

&amp;#x200B;

But he always emptied his Twitter feed shortly after warning of a stock market crash. This was his first tweet since March.

Meanwhile, bond bulls are facing their own crisis of faith, with some media suggesting that the bulls' last line of defense has now arrived. Carter Worth of CNBC said:

Goldman Sachs (319.78, -0.98, -0.31%) strategist MacNeil Curry pointed out last week that it's not just the 10-year note that's worth noting. Yields on 5-year and 2-year notes are also fast approaching or testing significant long-term trendlines, a breach of which would signal the end of the downtrend since the 1982 yield highs.

Curry says there is growing evidence that yields may struggle to break out of this downtrend, but if they do, it will be an important warning that the long-term bull trend is in the process of turning.

&amp;#x200B;

Curry noted that the end of the long downward trend in one-year Libor swaps is a significant development, but it does not mean that the US interest rate market in general is reversing the long-term bull trend that peaked in 1982 yields. For that to happen, we would need to see yields breach their 2018 highs (i.e. 30-year: 3.463%, 10-year: 3.262%, 5-year: 3.100%, 2-year: 2.989%), and these levels need to be watched closely."

Bond bulls face 'last Line of defense'

Meanwhile, bond bulls are facing their own crisis of faith, with some media suggesting that the bulls' last line of defense has now arrived. Carter Worth of CNBC said:

""A logarithmic move in the 10-year US Treasury yield shows that it is testing the most important trend line ever seen in any market.""

While 10-year Treasury yields rose above 2.80 per cent on Tuesday morning (before march's post-CPI plunge), they need to close above 2.83 per cent to mark a break in trend."

&amp;#x200B;

Mr Gundlach said the yield curve in the Treasury market was signalling ""trouble ahead"", pointing to the recent inversion of yields on two-year and 10-year notes, which historically has often heralded recessions.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Gundlach said the current stock market pattern is' very similar 'to the fourth quarter of 1999, referring to conditions before the dot-com bubble burst.

&amp;#x200B;

Okada, said the central bank's policy of quantitative easing and low interest rates ""has greatly stimulated the U.S. stock market, the s&amp;p 500 index over the past few years the unusually strong rise, but as a result of people's concern of the war between Russia and Ukraine, and expectations the fed will by raising interest rates to curb inflation, the index fell in the year to date. Mr. Gundlach said he expects European stocks to outperform U.S. stocks, especially if a recession hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Gundlach said that when yields on 2 - and 10-year Notes reverse, ""you should be on the lookout for a recession, and we are,"" but he added, ""I don't think we're going to have a recession this year because it takes time.""

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, Mr Gundlach said the rise in the cost of living in the US was ""much higher"" than reflected in the consumer price index. Wage growth and (7.12, -0.11, -1.52%) rent increases will be important drivers of inflation this year, he said.

&amp;#x200B;

""We think inflation will come down this year"" but remains high, Mr Gundlach said. He predicted inflation could fall to about 6% this year."

Jim Fitterling said nuclear would be ""another tool to allow us to reach our goal of zero carbon emissions"". ""We are currently looking at two sites in the US to provide technical support for a small modular reactor.""

Dow is already one of the world's biggest users of renewable energy, but Mr Fitterling said the intermittent nature of wind and solar meant nuclear would become a key source of energy.

Many  businesses mentioned here have different revenue streams, each can be analyzed using Porters  Five Forces analysis, but that's not the aim here, as the opportunity seems compelling without. 

 **Samsung Electronics' Valuation Is Attractive** 

Despite having diversified revenue streams and being one of the top players in each,  Samsung Electronics' trades at a discount of \~70-80% (on Enterprise Value/Next 12M  Revenue, Enterprise Value/L12M Revenue), and 12% (on a Price/Last 12M Free Cash  Flow) to its three comparables (Apple, Google, Microsoft). Samsung Electronics' current  TEV/ Revenue is about 1.5-2x that is significantly less than what some early-stage Silicon  Valley start-ups may be raising money at in this world (cases where business models may still be  lacking visibility and success).  \~67% of Samsung Electronics' Revenue in 2021 comes from its &amp; Mobile Communication  (36%) and Semi Conductor (31%) divisions, which in 2015 stood at 46% and 19%, respectively.  Samsung's top-line has has grown at CAGR of \~6% between 2015 and 2021 (vs. 8% for Apple),  but unlike Apple whose growth has fallen (\~21% CAGR between 2011 and 2015), Samsung  increased its (\~5% to 6%). Apple faces intense competition in its iPhone product line, whose  share as a percentage of Apple's revenue profile despite falling (66% in 2015 vs. 52% in 2021) is  still significant. 

**Smartphone Market Still Relevant, But Price Matters To Capture Growth Particularly from  Emerging Markets**   
Significant room for smart-phone penetration exists in the less developed markets, where  consumers generally tend to be more price-sensitive, and as income levels catch up with those of  advanced economies'. In order to capture these markets, it is important for smartphone vendors  to price their products attractively and appropriately 

 Samsungg Electronics has lost market share (19.5% in 2021 vs. \~22.1% in 2015) to Apple  (17.1%;15.8%) and Xiaomi (13.7%;4.9%) over the last six years. Average selling price of a  Xiaomi smartphone is significantly cheaper than Samsung and Apple's, which primarily explains  the rise. In order to understand Samsung and Apple's competitive positioning in the smartphone vendor  market, I carried out a small survey on 42 people with 70% of those based in North America.  Data sample is not meaningful in itself, but it could give a direction to where things might  eventually head. 72% of respondents want to pay between $300 - $1,000 for a smartphone,  with 63% wanting price increases to be capped; \~50% want the smartphone manufacturer to  integrate its tech/products with other devices (including those of competitors') that consumers  frequent. This implies to me that consumers are getting fed up up with continuous price  increases, but with limited innovation to show for. For instance, only 7% want companies to  keep on improving smartphone cameras and innovating in design features (screen size, colors).  Smartphones are still relevant for the reasons mentioned earlier: rising middle class levels in  emerging markets, where smartphone penetration pales in comparison to North America's, will  keep shipment volumes broadly stable. 

 **NAND Flash, Display, and Application Processing components are the most expensive  atoms in a smart-phone's body, and for all three, Samsung has a leading market share,  which means that it is less dependent on third-party suppliers for procurements.** This should  hedge it from rising input costs resulting from supply/demand imbalances or otherwise, and also  give it the ability to engage in price undercutting if the need arises. Samsung Electronics' average smartphone price is cheaper than Apple's, but expensive than  Xiaomi's. In order to capture Apple customers, Samsung's iTest initiative that was started two  years ago (Aug-2020) and which lets current Apple users experiment virtually with a Samsung  interface may be beneficial. In my survey, 40% of respondents stated that Samsung would be  their first choice, if switching vendors, while Apple and Google each getting ""voted first choice""  by 17%.  

**What Can Happen in Automobiles**   
Automobiles segment is something that tech firms have been eyeing closely for the last few  years now, with autonomous cars proclaimed as the next big thing. I don't understand the  technology or infrastructure as much as I'd like to, but to me it seems that this future is still a few  years off. Google's self-driving project was a failure. Apple still seems to be eyeing its own  version of self-driving cars (iCars) that will compete with the likes of Tesla and Ford, but no  reason to believe that Apple will be successful with this. Samsung, on the other hand, seems to  be devoting more to facilitate autonomous technology adaption than be a direct competitor,  via its focus on nodes, sensors, algorithm development. Samsung's revenue from its  Harman division that houses this tech. has grown at a CAGR of \~24% between 2017 (when  it launched) and 2021, but it is small, contributing \~3% to the overall revenue pie. Apple,  on the other hand, doesn't disclose this information. 

**FinTech is Another Market Tech Companies Are Targeting**   
As smartphone penetration increases, with most transactions originating through smartphone  anyways, fintech is poised to benefit. But just like the cloud market (where you have many  alternatives to pick from: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud being the most prominent), there is not a  dearth of options here. Paypal is the most entrenched in terms of market share, but it's got  Google Pay, Apple Pay trying to win territory. It is unclear how successful Google and Apple's  attempts will be, and also based on the table below, there seems to be no apparent reason why  Paypal will not be hold to its own. 

Switching costs are low for customers - Apple, for instance, might just might need to send out a  push notification to its Apple users to apprise them of this feature - though it might be time consuming for customers to fill in details. More importantly, unless for some odd reason their  existing provider's app keeps on breaking and / or causing nuisance issues (not that common),  arguably there is no reason for customers to switch. And from the above table I infer that even  though ApplePay might be successful, it'll come at the expense at significant free cash flow  because it doesn't seem to have a unique selling point. Samsung Electronics' has no exposure to  FinTech or such activities. 

**Crown Jewel: Semi Conductors**

 Although TSMC is the dominant player in this highly-concentrated semi-conductor space,  Samsung is second, and in terms of growth, it might have more runway. High capex intensity,  exclusive long-term relationship and factory building time generates high barriers to entry.  Unlike Apple, which relies on TSMC for its chips, Samsung does not seem to, and is in fact a  supplier that can take market share from TSMC. Of the myriad of applications that have strong  growth prospects and are dependent on semi-conductor foundries, gaming is one. Microsoft's  recent acquisition of Blizzard (game manufacturer) represents a EV/NTM Revenue and EBITDA  multiple of \~6.8x and 15.5, respectively, and gives insight into the former's strategic priorities. In  Feb 2021, it was reported that Advanced Microdevices, who supplies chips for Xbox and Sony  gaming consoles, was looking to outsource some of its GPU production to Samsung to ease its  dependence on TSMC, which is obviously positive news for Samsung. Samsung Electronics' performance across its semi-conductor segment reflects some kind of  competitive advantage. Revenue grew at a CAGR of 17% between 2019 and 2021, and operating  margins went up from \~26% to 33%. Semi-conductor revenue represented 31%, 24%, and 15%  of the top-line in 2021, 2019, and 2014, respectively, so clearly a growing core segment for  Samsung Electronics. Hard to say how future China/Taiwan relations may impact this segment  be it positively or negatively (and if at all). 

**What Can Samsung Electronics Potentially Do To Improve Its Market Perception?**  

You can do a Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation on each of their businesses, I am not doing this for you all, and it will be abundantly clear how undervalued this company is.

 1. Unclear to me whether Samsung compensates its executives in the form of stock options. It  obviously should, and so would be quite odd if it didn't, but there seems to be no disclosure on  this. Improving disclosure and transparency is important here. Apple, Google, Microsoft,  Amazon have this information easily accessible 

2. Samsung might have room to improve its brand awareness in Americas. Based on a few trips  to an A-grade mall located in a high foot area (downtown Toronto), I have been impressed and  shocked by how few people I see in the Samsung store (relative to Apple, which is hidden inside  the mall). One cannot miss the Samsung store. But traffic lags. I think needs to invest more in  SG&amp;A. For the sake of being consistent across all four comps, I am using SG&amp;A as a proxy for  marketing / advertising expenses, and Samsung's L4 year average SG&amp;A expense (as % of  revenue) has been 14%, while for Microsoft and Google, this is more in the 17-19% range.  Amazon, which is very well-known, still allocates \~20% of its top-line to SG&amp;A. Apple  meanwhile spends 6-7%. Maybe Samsung gets better celebrity endorsements. I can't claim that I  know what Samsung's marketing strategy should be here, but it needs some ZING. I understand  that is it not fully clear if these marketing dollars will generate revenue benefits, but they will  clearly impact cash flow, and so to converse or better manage cash flow, maybe the company can  explore some kind of strategic alternative with respect to its Consumer Electronic division. 

3. Unsure how much value Consumer Electronics adds to the overall Samsung Electronics'  business. There could be some cost and revenue-synergies in play, but in terms of historical  performance, revenue from this segment has barely increased at about 1% CAGR between 2015  and 2021, while operating margins have gone up (on average) by about 3.5%, implying that the  focus has been more on cost-reduction here. Of all the business lines that Samsung Electronics  has, this has had the lowest growth rate CAGR between 2015 and 2021, but as of FY 2021, still  contributed \~19% to top-line. Maybe it does no harm to retain this segment, but the TV market  (which I am using as a proxy for Consumer Electronics' segment) seems to be very mature.  Samsung 85 Inches 4K TVs costs less than a Apple MacBook, and this equation is indicative of  the level of competitive rivalry in the TV vendor industry (Sony, LG, Haier, Panasonic, and TCL  are the other big players here). I haven't spent a lot of time exploring what would be the best way  to proceed with this segment, but maybe spinning it off could be a possibility, generating some  free cash flow, allocating it to SG&amp;A and / or returning it to shareholders? 

4. Samsung's EBITDA to FCF conversion is nearly in-line with Apple's. But capital returned to  shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks (as a percentage of beginning cash  balance) has been around 40% over the last four years vs. 300% for Apple. Microsoft and  Google have returned about 300% and 130% respectively. Returning some capital here may send  the right, obvious signal here, which is that management thinks the market undervaluing the  stock here. Samsung's cash balance (converted in USD) is about \~$20-25BN, which is nearly as  much as Google's and almost twice Microsoft's. Now maybe it is preserving cash to build a semiconductor factory, I don't know, this cash can be better utilized. 

**What's Next?** 

I would not base this investment thesis on the 3 to 4 value creation levers outlined above, though  I do think they are important. Regardless of whether one chooses to believe them or not, the  reality is that Apple is trading at \~112% and 63% premium to its L4 average (pre 2021) EV /  Revenue and P/E valuation multiples, while for Samsung, these numbers are more in \~70% and  \~27% camp. Meanwhile the valuation gap between Samsung and Apple's is so immense that that  once you reflect on the growth prospects each has, you have to wonder why should not Samsung,  at the bare minimum, trade on Apple's valuation multiples a decade plus ago i.e. 2011 (if you  really want to give Samsung zero credit for what it's done since then and what's available to it  now going forward). If you believe that, then the returns from Samsung Electronics' stock could  be 130 - 230% range, but whether these returns materialize over the next 12M, 24M or even 48M  remains to be seen (I cannot point a catalyst). However, regardless of a catalyst, this seems like a  good medium to long term buy. Western investors usually have corporate governance concerns,  which might be reasonably-founded, but at these price levels, those concerns are somewhat  mitigated"

wallstreetbet,"Players May Play But PlayBoy Gutter-Bound (Play on Words)[Playboyyyyyy, whatcha gona do? | Wall Street Oasis](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/playboyyyyyy-whatcha-gona-do) 

Has anyone looked at Playboy recently? Seems like this company has the potential to go down, down and out.¬†

**Acquisitions:**

No ""organic"" growth strategy here to date, growing via acquisitions doesn't count as ""organic"" growth. Despite some of management team going to business school, they are not knowledgeable about this concept. Can't talk about each of their acquisitions, but their acquisition of Honey Bird was a colossal waste of resources. **They paid \~$230 million in CASH for a business that is barely** [**EBITDA** **profitable**](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-earnings-before-interest-tax-depreciation-and-amortization-EBITDA) **and not making more than US$10 million dollars on an annualized basis (what an outstandingly obnoxious multiple to pay)** Financials may be off by 5/10%, but the **broader gist here is that their capital allocation policies are out of ""**[**WACC**](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-weighted-average-cost-of-capital-WACC)**"".** Their ""Summary Financial Overview"" page on their Nov 2020 Investor Deck includes acquisitions, but if I was to strip out the results of TLA and Honey Bird, these folks would be off the mark by quite a bit.¬†¬†

**Cash Flows:**

They have \~US$67M in cash on [their balance sheet](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-a-balance-sheet-BS), maybe their bank allows them to draw more under existing credit facility agreements, but the key point here is that for the 9M 2021 ended, **their operating cash flow was a burn of $41 million, and if the growth strategy is to grow via acquisitions (which seems likely given historical patterns), they will be out of cash by next year.** Debt levels to cash flows are already unsustainable, and while they don't have any ""significant"" upcoming maturity post 2025, I also don't see any valuable assets that they can pledge to get more financing in the debt markets. **By the way, what do they need an Aircraft for? Is it to fly these ""models"" or for some other ""genuine"" purposes? They don't have any scale or profitability to be indulging in this kind of resource-squandering.** I have no idea how they are valuing these intangibles, but seems too good to be believable. **I do wonder though why did they not go with one of the Big 4s when it came to this exercise**‚Ä¶But anyways, I will get into the factors later, which will and should impact the value of their intangibles (see Liabilities section). Their only bet would be equity capital, but that will come at a high price assuming they are successful in the first place, as their current liquidation value suggests that there wouldn't be any leftovers for the equity folks‚Ä¶

**Accounting:**

**This relates to their auditor primarily, but I am very skeptical of their** **EBITDA** **adjustments.** They are adding back acquisition costs when they have a track record of growing via acquisitions, these seem to be very recurring in nature, same goes for their stock-based compensation. Yes it is non-cash in nature, but they are taking away equity from folks in the cap structure, and this should not be added back here. I am also doubtful about this **related party transaction, where they are** [**paying some management consulting**](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/guide/consulting-case-interviews) **firm $250K**, it might be a small amount, but to me, this points to some conflict of interest. Why is this consulting necessary, and what is the value-add that this service renders to other stockholders? All of this sounds extremely shady.¬†

**Business Operations:**

**Management talks about building a platform to get influencers and content creators, but network effects and reputation matters, and given their existing scale as well as lack of liquidity, prudent capital management, they don't have what it takes to compete with the likes of Instagram / Snapchat / TikTok.** To add further, these companies don't really have the sort of legacy issues that Playboy is dealing with here, which I am going to expand on now. All the segments that they aspire to enter (""Grooming and Beauty"", ""Gaming and Lifestyle"", ""Style and Apparel"") have companies with established moats and very limited-to-none legacy issues that I don't see them gaining any market share here. Please note that I have left ""Sexual Wellness"" out here, not because I think they have an advantage there, but because if you're not doing well in three segments, there will be no cross-pollination, and the Sexual Wellness will be more akin to an orphan / widow, whatever one desires to call it.

**Liabilities:**

Now dead founder, Hugh Hefner, has a tarnished legacy, and in today's world, no ""corporate-responsibility"" conscious customer would want to stock their products. I understand they have things at Walmart and CVS, but I am willing to wager that they are paying high shelf costs for this relative to their other customers. Similarly, their law suit with a Thai company that was announced end of last year will open them up to other potential law suits. **The models / ""content creators"" that they have on their platform are immature and/or porn stars, and / or have had their fair share of significant legal troubles. This is such a huge liability risk they are carrying that any sophisticated investor would want to stay away from their company**. The only potential customers I see for them are the likes of Jeffrey Epstein and his gang members. Maybe when Epstein 2.0 comes along, this company gets rekindled. It only takes a minute or two to dig up dirt on almost each of these content creators‚Ä¶Also, the acquisitions that they completed for stock will also come after them as the share price (on which the transaction was consummated) dwindles, so that's that, but they don't have a cash war chest to pay for acquisitions, and neither would it be a sensible move, so either way, Playboy loses here.

PS: I have no position in the company, and neither have I ever had any. This is more of a discussion topic, and this is my own proprietary idea that I haven't executed on. Welcome any conflicting views, but interested in hearing if folks here disagree¬†or agree. Some harsh and strong words here, but important to look at the broader gist¬†"

Already the 5g rollout is pushing profits upwards, and as technology continues to inovate, the upward trend will steepen.

Ok, most people have stopped reading, so I'll just post a copy paste from wikipedia so my post isn't too short. Obviously the 2 word title is sufficient. In 1984, the United States Department of Justice mandated AT&amp;T Corporation to break up the Bell System into seven companies, each a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), commonly referred to as ""Baby Bells"". Bell Atlantic,[11] one of the Baby Bells, came into existence the same year. Headquartered in Philadelphia, it became the parent of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and the C&amp;P Telephone companies, with a trading area from New Jersey to Virginia.

As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s, all of Bell Atlantic's operating companies assumed the holding company's name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. While Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City. In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving entity, changed its name to Verizon, a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon.[12]

In 2015, Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL,[13][14] and two years later, it acquired Yahoo!.[15] AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc.,[16] which was rebranded as Verizon Media in January 2019, and was spun off and rebranded to Yahoo! after its sale to Apollo Global Management.

As of 2016, Verizon is one of three remaining companies with roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. SBC Communications bought the Bells' former parent AT&amp;T Corporation and took on the AT&amp;T name, and CenturyLink acquired Qwest (formerly US West) in 2011 and later became Lumen Technologies in 2020.

Verizon's mobile network is the largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 120.9 million subscribers as of the end of Q4 2020.[17] And as of 2017, Verizon is the only publicly traded telecommunications company that has two stock listings in its home country, both the NYSE (principal) and NASDAQ (secondary).[18] As of 2017, it is also the second largest telecommunications company by revenue after AT&amp;T.

Quoted and put what he said so you don't have to click.

&gt;Kohl's ($KSS): Cramer said that Dick's has a great CEO, will succeed after the pandemic and stands out from other retailers.  
&gt;  
&gt;MongoDB ($MDB): MongoDB is a dime a dozen when it comes to software database companies, according to Cramer. ""Wall Street used to love a company that grew fast and lost a ton of money. Now, they just feel total contempt for them,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bumble: Cramer had few words about Bumble, which closed at $18.08 on Friday, well below its 52-week high of $76.49. ""Maybe romance is dead,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stitch Fix (SFIX): Stitch Fix is the third stock reporting earnings on Tuesday ‚Äî along with MongoDB and Bumble ‚Äî in bear market territory, Cramer said, adding that he's watching to see if they might find a floor and be worth a buy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Campbell Soup ($CPB): Campbell has to get their raw costs down, but the company ""will fly"" if it manages to report even moderate gains, Cramer said.  
&gt;  
&gt;CrowdStrike ($CRWD): Cramer said he expects Crowdstrike to report a strong quarter. However, its performance won't matter if inflation spikes that same day and hurts its stock, Cramer said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ulta Beauty ($ULTA): Cramer praised Ulta Beauty's consistent performance, adding that the company ""has the best chance of roaring higher next week."" He cautioned that the company is not ""a cheap stock.""  
&gt;  
&gt;DocuSign ($DOCU): Cramer said that DocuSign is suffering from being known as a ""Covid stock."" ""It's a very good company with a very bad stock,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rivian ($RIVN): Calling Rivian ""a poster child"" for western electric vehicle companies that have been ""losers for ages now,"" Cramer said that the company has lost its novelty.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wheels Up: Cramer said he'll be watching to see if the private jet company can get its stock up on Thursday. ""I bet they'll tell their story loud and clear,"" Cramer said, adding that it will be useless if the company doesn't actually turn a profit.  
&gt;  
&gt;eBay ($EBAY): ""It's a pretty clear story about an exchange where you can sell anything. For me, that's worth something,"" Cramer said of the e-commerce giant.  
&gt;  
&gt;AT&amp;T ($T): The company said it will give updates on its strategies for business and capital allocation during its analyst &amp; investor day. Cramer said he plans to listen to the call for positive signs but is skeptical. ""This is a company with uniquely terrible management ‚Äî we're talking 'Wall of Shame' bad ‚Äî and I have no desire to touch it,"" he said.

Is he going to be on the money this week or out of the money? I personally may inverse some of his opinions depending on my own DD."
wallstreetbet,"Oil, Shell, Russia and EuropeThe oil market is weird right now especially in Europe.  Production is rising so short term is ok but in the long term we will see countries going to renewables.  What does that mean for oil long term?  The demand of oil will always rise, right?  Also, ""Sell Shell"" has a nice ring to it.

wallstreetbet,"Coca cola's missing cocaine- who is america's plug?Coca cola imports around 100 metric tonnes of coca leaf every year to Stepan company, where it gets extracted into an alkaloid slurry (a black tarry mix of cocaine alkyloids and others). That gets sent to Mallinckrodt where cocaine is extracted to a tune of 1% gross yield from leaf. that's of 500-1000 kilos of cocaine. Coca cola makes up most of the coca imports into USA, and its supply chain is grandfathered in as the only one able to process coca material. 

This is really about drugs, but I'm going to start with Mallinckrodt which is the most shifty character in this supply chain.

The main medicine they produce with cocaine is acthar gel, which is worth $800,000/L for a gross profit of $350MM yearly. that's only accounting for at most 50 liters of gel form cocaine, or about 50 kg if it were made of pure cocaine (it's not but for this I'm assuming some loss). 

but then it goes to the medical supply market in raw form. for the AMAZING fucking price of $25/oz (page 33 of ""Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs"") so it aint worth shit. The demand for medical cocaine HCL in the usa for 2018? 29 KG. 

Surely they can't be backdooring cocaine out of a publicly listed company?

And then when they finally did get caught with oxycodone:

Which ultimately bankrupted them. So why did the stock never delist? It looks like they held it together just enough to make it all the way out of bankruptcy. So now we have a medical giant with a market cap of $9.2MM emerging from bankruptcy. And they're propped up by black market sales of most of their most addictive drugs. 

Which includes fentanyl- which is why I could never suggest to buy this horrendously undervalued company, but by financials and fundamentals the company is worth more than 9 million in assets right now- by about 51 million on acthar's patent alone. These guys are likely providing sketchy buyers drugs that are killing Americans. 

so why did this easy target not get shorted into the dirt? unable to borrow and unable to pay its debt, no money to buy shares back. It should have gone down as unsuccessful, with patents sold at auction. Why did no other corp acquire it? There's no reason why they'll stay at 0.12 per share- this is a company that was well over 1.2 billion market cap before bankruptcy with shares around $50.

The answer I believe lies in 420-920 missing kilos of 99.9% pure cocaine HCL every year. Here's where it's for sale:

TLDR summary : Many seem to be seeing this as a 2 part play. Short term we have this catalyst coming March 7th/8th. Long term, this company has amazing revenue projections and is in a field that is only projected to grow in importance and revenue. The volume on this ticker has been very low (62,000 daily average) but has increased quickly to over 400,000 on 2/24/2022 and 795,000 on 2/25/2022 and was trading between 450-950,000 volume this last trading week. Options trading is heavily leaning towards calls indicating that an SP raise is likely in the near future. 

Quarterly earnings report will be announced soon and is expected to take place later this month. 

This increase in volume may be due to the increasing conflict in Ukraine and the sudden interest for investors in AI, cyber security. It may have been kept ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù until now due to market sentiment being negative at the current moment as well as how new this company is to being public.

They seem to be growing rapidly (Q3 2021 revenue growth of &gt;200% y/y) and though they're still making losses, their revenue as well GPU (gross profits per unit sold) are both on a high growth trajectory ([https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/12/shift-technologies-inc-sft-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/12/shift-technologies-inc-sft-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/) )

I only started looking at their stock after I bought a car from them and had an excellent experience at one of their test drive centers (that happened to be near where I live).  I was shocked to see the price they were trading at.  I am nowhere near a skilled investor  from my naive perspective, this company shouldn't be trading at this low a price, especially given covid bump in used car prices and their growth trajectory. Can anyone  here who is good at such things explain what's going on? Am I missing something or have I discovered a hidden gem for my portfolio?"

**Predictions**

The CPI data released on Thursday before open is what basically all retail and big funds will be watching, Powell has stated that if inflation gets worse then the federal reserve will have to do stronger rate hikes.  Commodities are soaring: wheat futures, crude oil futures.  While the big money does not want to admit it, the inflation data released on the 10th will be worse than most people are expecting.   The situation in Ukraine is sadly not getting any better; Russia announced a ceasefire and then continued to shell buildings.  Since inflation is getting worse and commodities are soaring the fed is now forced into drastic measures to raise the interest rates.

From the technical indicators the whole market is extremely bearish.  On the NASDAQ 100 the 50 day moving average has crossed the 200 day moving average which is known as a ""death cross"" signaling a long term bear market.  The RSI is above 50 on SPY so selling pressure will be coming soon.

I really think that another red week is on the way.  The market will pullback in anticipation for the CPI data release and it will be very interesting to see what happens afterward. 

\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more

Too late to safely short there, which is why I‚Äôm making this post early on this time since I got complaints for not sharing DD on [Russian Puts](https://i.imgur.com/vgbhgPN.jpg)

But we can potentially get in as early investors  to the next EU state. 
The Marshall plan https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan pushed 13 Billion dollars (before inflation) into war torn Europe after WWII, and is partially the reason why Germany is now an economic powerhouse. Ukraine is currently the focus of the whole world, soon to be the newest EU state, and is going to need to be rebuilt now that Russia is openly bombarding cities. 

Ukrainian construction shares are actually down right now due to an active war causing short term uncertainty, while also being one of the first groups in Ukraine to start being funded once the rebuild starts. Goldman Sachs is already doing this with Russia (which is bold considering the volatility there)

Here‚Äôs where I need your help to brainstorm how/when/which Ukrainian contractors/banks/investment groups are going to be optimal to buy calls and/or go long on. If we buy before the common consensus is to fund the rebuild, we can potentially benefit off of something morally good for once, so at least you assholes can feel good ethically while you gamble your kids college funds."

International energy companies have continued their exodus from projects in Russia in response to the invasion into Ukraine, prompting threats of criminal prosecution from the Kremlin on Friday.

Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeny Belousov reacted angrily to the growing list of international companies and investors either winding down or suspending their operations and ending joint ventures with Russian partners.

Belousov said that foreign companies originating in nations now imposing sanctions will only be permitted to continue their business in the country if they provide full support and supplies to their Russian subsidiaries, according to reports carried on Russian state news agency Tass.

Investors will also be given an option to transfer their holdings and ventures to appointed Russian business leaders, with a possibility to take back their assets once sanctions are removed.

Finally, he warned those international investors that simply leave will be considered as pushing their Russian subsidiaries into what Belousov described as ‚Äúdeliberate bankruptcy‚Äù.

Under the Russian law, ‚Äúdeliberate bankruptcy‚Äù entails administrative liability, such as fines, and criminal prosecution of top managers or shareholders of a company."

I think while military invasion will probably still happen I think it will be more of a relentless amount of cyber attacks that will devastate the little island nation causing there production to cease all together for a few weeks minimum. 

AAPL heavily realize on there exports to make there phones this should cripple there stock and tesla may also get hurt as well along with Intel.

- Vladimir Putin has now committed himself to orchestrating a regime change in Kyiv. Anything less would be seen as a defeat for him.
- Assuming he succeeds, and it is far from obvious that he will. the resulting insurgency will drain Russian resources. Along with continued sanctions, this will lead to a further deterioration in Russian living standards and growing domestic discontent.
- If Putin concludes that he has no future, the risk is that he will decide that no one else should have a future either.
- Although there is a huge margin of error around any estimate, subjectively, **we would assign an uncomfortably high 10% chance of a civilization-ending global nuclear war over the next 12 months**. These odds place some credence on Brandon Carter's highly controversial Doomsday Argument. 
- Even if World War III is ultimately averted, l markets could experience a freak-out moment over the next few weeks, similar to what happened at the outset of the pandemic. Google searches for nuclear war are already spiking.
- Despite the risk of nuclear war, it makes sense to stay constructive on stocks over the next 12 months. If an ICBM is heading your way, the size and composition of your l portfolio becomes irrelevant. Thus, from a purely financial perspective, you should largely ignore existential risk, even if you do care about it greatly from a personal perspective."

The Ty tags on these things are absolutely PRISTINE, and that's how you know they're still good. And unlike corn, these are physical assets that can't get hacked or drastically diminish in value overnight due to volatility. 

I am also hoarding Adderall, as this will prove an excellent store of value in the event of a nuclear fallout post-apocalyptic Mad Max type scenario. This is called diversification. But I am not selling the Adderall, only the Beanie Babies.

I possess many of the rarest Beanie Babies, including Nana the Monkey and Valentino the Bear. DM for inquiries. Do not DM for Adderall. Thanks.

1) If RU win the war and occupy Ukraine, the sanctions continue and RU will be like Cuba for decades

2) If EU and US sanctions RU oil and gas, RU will be fucked within months.

3) If Putin senses that he's going to lose the war, he could try other tactics like scorch earth in Ukraine before signing a withdraw treaty. This would again keep EU and US sanctions mostly in place."

&amp;#x200B;

We're only up 25% from the original news of the war meaning its only been a 1 week and abt 3 days. But a new sanction is about to come. The U.S will soon sanction Russia's oil exports to the U.S. Why is this such a big deal? Russia is 2nd biggest exporter globally with about 72.6 billion being about 11% globally. ""Keep in mind this will only happen as war escalates."" More specifically for the US imports of petroleum including OIL is about 7% and is currently 3rd on the leaderboard after Canada and Mexico. A possibility is other countries might react but that's not really important. We've already seen U.S Gas companies sell most if not all there holdings of anything Russia gas related. - [https://fortune.com/2022/03/03/russia-oil-embargo-us-europe-consequences/](https://fortune.com/2022/03/03/russia-oil-embargo-us-europe-consequences/)

We've seen this before believe it or not. During 1990-1992 Iraq invaded Kuwait Oil prices skyrocketed from 15$ per gallon to 33$ per gallon making it 120% increase over the weeks of the original invasion. One last possible catalyst is once summer gets closer, it means travel season gas prices hold right now which would be huge airlines would fail and there stocks would plummet.

Once we hit these high levels I plan on shorting oil for a while until we hit back under the 100's."

wallstreetbet,"$MRVL Fraud or Opportunity?I have been looking at $MRVL Marvel Technology following their earnings to figure out if it is a true high margin company or a big scam. 

The company just reported $4.4b for 2021 versus $2.9b for 2020 due to strong demand and two  large acquisitions. They focus on clouds, 5g, automotive and so on with around 50% gross margin. The technology looks great and the product range differentiated for future applications. The investor day gave a good sense of the know-how. All good at this point, but wait..

https://preview.redd.it/96p5z4bi2il81.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94106f0be78e0295739489123e22af2f2d5c5f33

They reported **-421M net income and 6M net income** **for the last quarter.** How is this possible? So now, my retarded brain is burning like crazy. 

https://preview.redd.it/4sr2r8yy2il81.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7425ffd88c53bb8371f902d42167ac69e7159262

I look at the financials to find a one time item that could explain it like large investment, impairment, restructuring and so. There is stuff but all minor compared to the income level. And I don't get it, we are not talking about a start up investing ahead of the curve or lacking scale. So I looked at the operating expenses and then I fell off my chair. 

**The R&amp;D expenses are $1.4b, meaning more than 30% of sales**. In comparison, NVIDIA spends 6%, Apple 7%, AMD spends 8% and Microsoft 13%. What is going on? Are they allocating cost to R&amp;D to show higher margin? The R&amp;D expenses are the main reason of the lack of net income as well as stock compensation. And I could not find a good explanation to the scale in any documents including the investor day, last year 10k and other financial reportings. 

https://preview.redd.it/5wo4uevg3il81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e1c048ed9c5e57e5e2b034c9bda338515a90dc7

I look at the debt, good will and so on to see if they are leveraging to ride the wave and mislead investors to get as much as possible out for the management. The company has $4.4b in long term debt which seems fine for the size of the company, but it is not if they never generates higher net income. We also have a huge $11b goodwill which will likely be partially write off in the coming years. 

The company is clearly leveraged but not excessively if the operating margin is real. But the $55b market cap is justified on the high ""margin"" and great future return to the shareholder. I don't see it having already the best market in years, size, acquisition synergies and growth; and despite this they still have a 2300 PE. 

I also look at what the management is doing with their shares. They should hold considering the bright future ahead. And nope, they are selling in particular the CEO and CFO pretty much every quarter.  

https://preview.redd.it/u6b5v9115il81.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcb2b030e037cf2587c39a47715b8c754eb775ab

So here is my question to the community: **What am I missing?** 

I saw a lot of great posts and DD on the company but nobody is talking about the crazy R&amp;D expense and ""true margin"" including during earning calls. And while I am a believer in semi-conductors, **I cannot understand a high margin business making no money.**

I am calling on the retards community to help me understand this one and decide if I am going short or long position on this stock. Hopefully someone can explain this TENET situation to me."

wallstreetbet,"3/31/22 Spy Daily Ta3/31/22 SPY Daily TA 

Well that was one of the wildest and craziest power hours I have seen in a long ass time. That reminded me of the days we used to have back in January where we would see SPY make wild 1%+ moves in an hour. Last time we had volume of 121mil/ day and movement like this was the start of the bear market back in January. Could April showers bring sorrows and bear arrows? 

https://preview.redd.it/gpal863gctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1558cc49d0e8655d53d5f897a50cf7307e92f3

Despite the essentially flat pre-market we saw quickly entering the intraday this morning we saw spy establish a bear trend with candles below the 8ema. And that is pretty much where we stayed all day. We saw a nice dip to 456.6 at open that led to a recovery to 458.76 around 11am. That morning recovery should have been everyone signal to buy puts for the end of the day as all the signs of a dip fill to 455.91 and potentially even a dip near 454 were clear and present around mid day. However, due to the wild reversals we have had the last two weeks we had to play it safely and unfortunately missed out on some incredible gains. 

However, end of the day brought the fire works. Start of power hour we saw the shake out fake rip to 457.36 before we saw spy jump off a cliff with one of the wildest power hours ive seen that took us to a low of 451.16 before finally closing at 451.63. That is an incredible 1.37% dip in one hour. Considering our intraday range was $2.7 till about 245pm the fact that SPY covered over $3 in an hour is quite impressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gzz5hzygctq81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88eae5847685c5a055a4c5717c596f8bf3fc86d1

Now that we have potentially ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù we will look at the downside levels that have not been in play for almost 3 weeks. 

The next levels down support wise (major supports) are 450 ÔÉ† 446 ÔÉ† 443 ÔÉ† 436

The next major resistance will be 459.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we are also see two channels‚Ä¶ the dotted channel that I refer to as the levels which support is intraday tomorrow would be 450 and resistance would be 458.5.

https://preview.redd.it/k7hb4p3ictq81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1dad19dca701e7b16c851b91635d1ab90d34a0e

The solid line downward channel puts resistance at 455 and support down near 447. 

https://preview.redd.it/seizqg1jctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69717795b1650eb859a89204d9457801c930a7f0

The daily candle close today is quite telling if you ask me. It closed BELOW the daily 8ema for the first time Since March 15th which you guessed it was the first green day of this massive two week long bull run we just went on. While the candle body is only below the 8ema if bears can gap this down tomorrow we just may see a full close below the 8ema which is very bearish. 

Also of note is the fact that this is the first candle closed below fully below the mid point of the grey channel we have been trading within. That tells me the bulls finally lost momentum today. Support of the channel tomorrow would be at 452.5 any movement below that and we have officially broken the bull channel. That means bulls have to gap this up tomorrow and keep her green all day. 

This is also the first back to back red days since the March 14th bottom. 

Todays volume at 122mil was the highest volume since you guessed it March 14th. Which that candle volume was 144mil and started the incredible bullrun we just went on. 

With a new month starting tomorrow and monthly expire that took place today, along with the massive end of day sell off there is a very real possibility that the bear market dead cat bounce is being confirmed and we will now start pushing back to 420 range. 

As much as I would like to tell everyone go buy 30dte puts and youll be rich‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt trust anyone at all. I don‚Äôt trust the MM not to run this back to ATH next week. The worst part about this bullrun we just had the last 2 weeks is that I will not be fully convinced of a bear market dead cat bounce until its too late to even capitalize on it properly. 

However, once the bears (if they truly are back in control) can get SPY back under the daily 200 ema at 439.33 I will then be convinced we are going to retest the 410-420 lows. However, at that point I would be waiting for a 410 retest. If 410 was to hold and see a convincing double bottom I would be looking for some 2-3year LEAPS to purchase. If 410 was to break I would still fully expect a dip near 380. 

The VIX intraday saw a spike to 21.5 after being pretty flat all day between 19.5 and 20.5. With the vix closed above 20.5 And spy well below where it was the last time VIX was at 20.5 if the vix continues to trend back up we just might see some more downside. As always all eyes on the VIX. It did not lead us astray today or at all this week.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4bl5ee9kctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e4409b6f0832658d580b1f8048c90bfeedfe01

As you guys know I strongly believe Apple is a gateway into what SPY will do and their correlation is very strong. Looking at the daily chart of Apple we see a similar set up. It closed a candle below the mid support of the channel for the first time in 2 week and saw now back to back red days for the first time in two weeks. Apple however was able to keep its close above the daily 8ema at 173.55. I fully anticipate apple to start heading back down and break its daily 8ema tomorrow too. With the RSI now in a downtrend I will be keeping all my eyes on Apple tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

10% daily challenge-

Today was another great day of trading in the server. I probably had one of the best weeks I have had since January so far. 

I made 4 total trades today. 

A 0dte put at open for 10% gain. 

A 0dte put that I had to hold all the way to -50% before I was finally able to average down and secure a 20% gain on. 

A 4dte put during power hour that I tapped for 25% which of course ran to well over 100% at close. But after greed killed my gains on Monday and obviously no one knowing we were going to dump that far (I fully expected 454 but not 451‚Ä¶) I had to secure profits and then I was out of buying power by that time. 

I also played a 8dte Apple put that I was going to hold over night (had bought around 230pm before it broke its support) but ended up selling before close for 45% gain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall another great trading day. 

Going into tomorrow im currently sitting just under 3x my weekly profit goal and I am going to be very patient and not erase all my gains this week. Being a Friday I have no idea what to expect but the last few Fridays have been quite great trading days for me. I do know the last week every morning trading session has been nothing but chop and tight $2-$3 ranges before we finally make a massive end of day move. I will be patient and I will make my moves count. After 3 days in a row of nearly making my weekly profits in one day im gonna stay humble and not get greedy.

Remember greedy and cockiness kills."

wallstreetbet,"ELI5 GME DivvyDisclaimer: I do not currently hold ANY GameStop stock and haven‚Äôt for over a year.

Person A - owns 10 shares of GME
Person B - shorts 10 shares of GME
Person C - counter-party that buys the 10 shorted shares from Person B

Person A and person C technically own the same 10 shares simultaneously. In the case of a 3:1 dividend split, person A‚Äôs shares will be split and they now own 30. However, person C‚Äôs split shares already went to person A. So it is *Person B‚Äôs responsibility to BUY enough shares to make Person C whole*. Essentially, this dividend will force shorts hands to cover their position prior to the ex-div date. Very smart by move by RC.

The dividend goes up for a vote by the board on 6/9 lol. 

Special dividend have caused short squeezes in the past, see examples as $OSTK or $BGFV. If you believe that short interest in GME is still high, this could be an interesting play. 

I have no plans to buy GME, but I will be watching closely in the coming months."

wallstreetbet,a fish did better than you guys.[removed]
wallstreetbet,"Investing adviceI've seen how well a goldfish can manage money, but I'm wondering if there's a better fish to invest in. I'm a fan of those Japanese fighting fish because they've got funny colours and my brother had one with a nice moustache, but I don't know if they're as good as a goldfish. Been thinking about a catfish as well but I don't know if its size could mess stuff up. Any idea on a good fish that could make some good money?"
wallstreetbet,"How does it feel to be out performed by a fish guys.If you havent watched michael reeves new video give it a watch. And realize that wallstreetbets is just a bunch of guys who will help you lose money asking you to invest in their investments and youre better off trusting a fish.

wallstreetbet,Thr Original WSB Kid
wallstreetbet,"Inflation, Food Shortages and Rising Rates = ?Everyone knows what's going on with inflation and shortages.

But what is the coming food shortage all about?

In the EU, Biden stated some thing about food shortages coming when answering questions.  Slip or not, now the PM of Canada, Justin Trudeau, has announced a coming food shortage.

One thing I have learned in the past couple years is that when two leaders of western countries say the same thing, it will become one narrative for all media and leaders.  



So let me get the basics straight here:

We have 40 yr record inflation.

We have interest rates rising, rapidly.

We have bond yields increasing straight up.

We have record government, corporate and personal debt.

5yr and 30yr bonds inverted.

2yr and 10 yr bonds just barely inverted today.

And now we have food shortages on the horizon.




This recipe spells fuckin disaster.  


Costs for consumers go up from debt service costs to all necessities and wants.  Wants will all go away.  

Consumer economy will fuckin suck.

Job markets going to fuckin suck.

Debt service costs are going to deflate asset prices.



Was BofA right about the bear market continuing and the fib retracement being complete?



This is way worse than I thought a couple months ago. I though bond market was going to be a bit more stable.



The only thing certain is that the Russian Ruble is almost back to normal value since Russia said they're going to a gold standard.



AND I still have no fuckin idea what to do other than buy GME."

Now GME is announcing a stock split! I should‚Äôve saw this coming, for some reason king ape cohen bought all those stocks last week. 

Two rules in life that I should be living by but always fail. #1 Don‚Äôt mess with Papa Elon.  #2 Don‚Äôt short GME.

wallstreetbet,"Ok, I need some DRS and hedgie questions answered by you apesOk, so everyone's been talking about DRSing the shares from my broker (Fidelity). 

From what I understand, this has the effect of turning them from (basically) being phantom shares that the hedgies can still screw with, to actual, in-my-name shares that can't be claimed by the hedgies as magical non-existing shares that they continue to short.

I also understand that by DRSing the shares, any dividends get paid to me quickly since those shares are ""on the books"" in my name and my name only and I don't have to wait for the brokers to suss out which shares are real and which shares are imaginary hedgie-shorted fever-dreams.

But then I also hear people talking about the ""infinity pool"" and how DRS'd shares SHOULDN'T be sold even when the MOASS happens, and for the life of me I don't understand why. The whole purpose of buying GME is so that when it goes up past the stratosphere, I sell what I bought for more money. Why would I buy something just to not sell it, ever? Theoretical gains are great. ACTUALIZED gains are, well, ACTUALLY useful. So what gives?

Lastly, let's imagine a situation where a hedgie's shorted GME out the wazoo, the apes have come home to roost, and the shares are worth infinity-bajinity dollars each. What's stopping the hedgie from, instead of paying infinity-bajinity dollars per share into the pockets of apes, simply saying ""whoopsy poopsy, we can't pay all this; we're declaring bankruptcy?"" Like, their assets will be liquidated and proportionally given out to the people who it's owed to, but doesn't this essentially limit the stock's value to the value of the hedgie itself? Why would people think the shares would go higher than that?

Be gentle with this smoothbrain, apes. Be gentle."

BlueWalker 3 satellite launch on track for summer üöÄüöÄüöÄ‚ÄúSince our last quarterly business update, our global team has worked diligently to substantially complete the assembly of, and critical testing milestones related to our next satellite, BlueWalker 3. The satellite is on schedule for our planned summer launch and all testing and integration are near completion,‚Äù said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile.

Mr. Avellan added, ‚ÄúIn our first year as a public company, we have achieved important technical milestones to position ourselves for the planned launch of BlueWalker 3, which will bring to a close our initial development phase.

wallstreetbet,"Recent trading performance for those who are interested in my unique approach to day-tradingFor a little bit of context, I'm a Data Scientist by trade so I'm all about the power of data and the possibilities that machine learning (and then AI) can present. I am very experienced in building python ML models for finance e.g debt forecasting, so it has not been much of a stretch to migrate over to a trading ML model.

I've been day-trading at a high level for around 2 years now, using an established indicator structure I found worked well on trading view as well as a few 'gut-feel' punts. Over the 2 years I've grown my portfolio from around 11K to around 150K, which is great, but could have been into the millions had I not closed some crazy opportunistic positions prematurely (notably GBPvUSD circa April '20). I use mixed out leverage (300:1), as in addition to these funds I have other cash reserves and previously worked as an intra-day gas storage trader so qualify for 'professional privileges'.

Onto the model itself; it ran for one day on Friday and had returns of 5% which was incredibly positive. I'm going to leave it hooked up to the OANDA API for a month, with looping trades every 5 minutes and backtest efficacy after this.

**MACHINE LEARNING strategy;**

For ML strategy, I used an ensemble approach, with underlying layers of random forest, neural network, xgboost, sentiment analysis, clustering and k-nearest neighbour. I run the code on a perpetual loop to identify criteria which match the buy/sell parameters and then the bot makes the update appropriately through the API.

The primary input datapoints are indicators (Fibonacci retracement for support levels, RSI, EMA, MACD, stochastic oscillator, Bollinger bands), plus historic prices, movement over time etc. It is an ensemble build with layers of random forest, neural network, xgboost, sentiment analysis, clustering and k-nearest neighbour.

First step is to understanding the correlations and relationships between variances in these indicators (different time period, combined with other indicators), to establish somewhat of a correlation relationship between indicators and stock price movement within 5 time periods (1, 5, 15, 30, 1hr , day). Then draw out most efficacious indicator combinations for buy/sell conditions and tag on ML iterative improvement capability, as well as ongoing outputs of ‚Äòbest setup‚Äô running profit. The first output so to speak is regression analysis of indicators vs % movement in stock price within x time. In this way you could classify this is a regression model approach overall.

I plan to use a 5% trailing stop clause for risk mitigation and ultimately hope to be able to clear ¬£5K per day and just allow the bot to run and do its thing.

Side note:- the best time to trade is immediately following american markets opening at 3.00pm. Here you will find extreme swings, volatility and the opportunity to grab ¬£20K in under 30s.

Hope this goes some way to inspire others that it can be done with hard work, educating yourself and self-discipline around goals and outcomes. I plan to retire at 40 and am on track for that currently.

**\*\*UPDATE:**

My strategy has not really changed, positions opened based on indicator criteria being met and then closed again very quickly, often within 1-2 mins. I do not carry over positions into following days. I make use of stop losses carefully calculated to avoid margin call instances and close gain positions without being overly greedy. My favourite trades are GBP USD and SP500.

Doing this manual day trading I have turned 10k into &gt;150k. This over 2 years and including a period where I was ‚Äòout of the game‚Äô suffering with bad depression (see period of heavy losses).

I finished turning this strategy into the algo equivalent about 3 weeks ago and have been testing it (with small funds and no leverage) to gauge effectiveness. At present it is showing very encouraging returns, with far higher volume of trades and average % win of 60%. After 8 weeks I will complete a full statistical review of the model and then look to up the pool of funds. In addition to converting my manual approach, it incorporates ML elements to move it 'to the next level'. As mentioned, it is in essence a ratio driven ensemble model, with the strategy being to optimise the perfect mix of indicators to deliver the highest % win ratio - it uses a variety of different algorithms, but the emphasis is always on the statistical relationships, so I have not used a deep learning or neural network approach.

Contrary to common belief, I have yet to lose all my funds as the risk mitigation through appropriate stop losses and very short duration trades means this is very manageable.¬†

So perhaps I continue to defy expectations, but I think If you play the game with everything carefully calculated; risk v reward and maintain an approach of 3-5 trades a day, open for \~5mins, you can use high leverage effectively.¬†

I hope to be able to one-day sell this model as a product if it maintains its efficacy and perhaps build a community around how to play the system, manage risk and make solid returns.

wallstreetbet,"Wall Street Journal doesn't understand the concept of BetaIn their flawed article today, the Wall Street Journal did the following calculation.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-we-analyzed-wall-street-block-trades-11648647951](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-we-analyzed-wall-street-block-trades-11648647951)

"" S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence classifies Kraft Heinz as a consumer staples company. On Aug. 7, 2018, the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples Index closed down 0.60%, giving Kraft Heinz a market-adjusted return for the day of negative 1%.

If Kraft Heinz‚Äôs share price had mirrored the performance of the consumer-staples sector, falling 0.6% instead of 1.6%, it would have closed the day at $61.95. If Morgan Stanley got the same 2.4% discount on that price, the bank would have paid $60.50 per share.""

I did a quick check to see -- on days of material movement, i.e. on days when KHC's stock price moved 1% up or down, how much its beta was relative to the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples Index. On those days, IT MOVED AN AVERAGE OF 16X THE CHANGE IN THAT INDEX (11x the change if you exclude outliers.)

You can replicate the calc from the data here.  I'd attach the spreadsheet but I don't know how.

Gamestop $GME announces stock dividend which is what Novation Co $NOVC Barry Igdaloff Chairman of Board should do immediately to Cut off Short Sellers unless he is behind the shorting see www.otcshortreport.com ? Why would Igdaloff and his co investors do such a thing? The only reason Chairman of the Board Barry Igdaloff would balk is because he and his co investors are behind the shorting. Why it repels other investors Mr. Market and suppresses $NOVC share price buying time for Co CEOs of Fortress to buyback Fortress from Softbank before triggering a real restructuring plan at $NOVC. By Shorting and Spreading FUD fear uncertainty and DISINFORMATION they further provide the basis to allocate 47M shares of Novation Co $NOVC at less then ONE PENNY to themselves 16M RSU for Board of Directors (Barry Igdaloff, Howard Amster and Chuck Gillman, Jeff Eberwein's appointees) and 31.3M NOVC common to their Co Investors CDOs owned by Taberna CDO I and II owned Fortress and Kodiak CDO I owned by EJF Capital.

BEIJING ‚Äî China reported data Friday that showed a pickup in growth in August from the prior month. The data also came in above expectations across the board.

Retail sales grew by 5.4% in August from a year ago, topping a Reuters forecast for 3.5% growth. Industrial production rose by 4.2% in August from a year earlier, beating the 3.8% increase estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts

Fixed asset investment for the first eight months of the year rose by 5.8%, above the 5.5% increase forecast by Reuters. Investment in manufacturing picked up the most, up by 10% from the year-ago period. Infrastructure investment grew at a slower pace than in July, on a year-to-date basis.

Real estate investment for the year declined further as of August, down by 7.4% from the year-ago period versus a 5.2% decline reported for the year as of July.

The unemployment rate for young people ages 16 to 24 edged lower to 18.7% in August. It remained far higher than the overall unemployment rate in cities, which was 5.3% in August, down slightly from the prior month.

China‚Äôs economy has remained under pressure due in part to Covid controls, which notably stranded tens of thousands of tourists in the tropical island of Hainan in August.

The summer month was also marked by extremely hot temperatures in parts of China, prompting temporary power rationing in some regions.

Export growth slowed to 7.1% year-on-year in August, signaling that driver of Chinese growth might be waning as global demand falters. Domestic demand remained weak, with imports only rising by 0.3% from a year ago.

China‚Äôs consumer price index edged down from two-year highs to show a 2.5% year-on-year increase in August. But excluding food and energy, the index only rose by 0.8%, again reflecting lackluster demand.

The slump of the massive real estate sector has also weighed on demand. A few weeks earlier, Chinese developer¬†Country Garden¬†described the property market has having ‚Äúslid rapidly into severe depression.‚Äù"

I was a bit early, but the play seems to be ready to go now.  Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x7apdr/gety\_508311\_float\_still\_in\_tact\_confirmed\_by\_ir/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x7apdr/gety_508311_float_still_in_tact_confirmed_by_ir/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

To update the situation:

Float is still 508,311 as there still hasn't been an EFFECT filed.  Float was recently confirmed by the CFO of Getty Images. 

Short interest has drastically increased since my last post.  Ortex has it at 125%!!!  S3 is showing 930,000 shares short which would make it 183%!!!  Either way, MASSIVE SHORT INTEREST!  Currently number 9 on the Fintel Short Squeeze list but we could see that improve tomorrow as the Price Momo metric should've improved after today.

Cost to borrow still around 1000%, IF you can even find shares to borrow.

Max pain is $25 tomorrow for MOPEX.

Saw highs of $15.72 in AH tonight.  Was trending number 1 on stocktwits (currently 3). Big names are on the play, so we should be able to get the volume tomorrow to really squeeze this play.  Good luck to all. 

As I mentioned in my last post, I have $14 and $15 calls expiring tomorrow.

Good luck to all!

Rumble Video will be trading on the Nasdaq as a freshly merged symbol **RUM** on Monday. The valuation is 2.5 Billion atm which is ridiculous. It's been stuck in the SPAC phase so it's always had a floor of $10 and couldn't go lower. For most of the time after the initial business announcement a year ago it's been pretty much right at $10 flat. It could never fall below $10 cause SPAC. During the run-up people bid it up 40% so I went super short. However, when Monday comes it can finally fall below $10 which it will. Honestly at $5 (1 Billion valuation) is still too high but that's when I will cover my positions. I honestly think most people in this forget that this stock can actually fall below $10 when it starts trading on the Nasdaq as RUM on Monday.

wallstreetbet,"Policy bubble?I've been revisiting the 1973 quarterly chart and can't help but see some similarities between the current trajectory. Inflation was little over 6% in '73. The following years inflation was about 11% in '74 and 9% in '75. The drastic changes that occurred during this period fundamentally changed the system which allowed us to incur this massive deficit. 

My argument is that the current bubble might be a policy bubble. And I'm suspecting a big fundamental change to the system again.

I know this might be a silly argument because I haven't fleshed out the entire mechanics of this so it seems straightforward. I acknowledge that it isn't this straightforward. Unpacking the totality of this would consume a full written series to explore. I wanted to get the gist of it out.  

So, I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on why this fundamental change could be possible, or why it wouldn't  be possible?

Perhaps digitalization is the excuse for a substantial shift?

wallstreetbet,"FedEx cutting costs, withdraws 2023 guidance after first-quarter shipments disappointFedEx on Thursday withdrew its full-year guidance and announced significant cost-cutting measures following what it called softness in global volume of shipments.

‚ÄúGlobal volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter, both internationally and in the U.S.,‚Äù CEO Raj Subramaniam said in the release. ‚ÄúWhile this performance is disappointing, we are aggressively accelerating cost reduction efforts.‚Äù

As part of these cost-cutting initiatives, FedEx will close 90 office locations, close five corporate office facilities, defer hiring efforts, reduce flights and cancel projects.

FedEx stock fell about 12% in extended trading Thursday.

The updates come alongside fiscal first-quarter earnings that fell well short of Wall Street expectations. The company was scheduled to release results and hold a conference call with executives next week, but issued the report early.

Here‚Äôs how FedEx performed in the period, ended Aug. 31, based on Refinitiv consensus estimates:

- Earnings per share: $3.44, adjusted vs. $5.14 expected


- Revenue: $23.2 billion vs. $23.59 billion expected

The performance led FedEx to withdraw its full-year forecast that was set in June, citing a volatile environment that precluded prediction. The company reduced its forecast for capital expenditure for the year by $500 million to $6.3 billion.

The company cited specific weakness in Asia as well as challenges to service in Europe for its underperformance in the first quarter. While these factors choked shipping volume, the company said operating expenses remained high. FedEx reported an adjusted operating income of $1.23 billion.

For its fiscal second quarter the company expects adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.75 on revenue of between $23.5 billion to $24 billion. Wall Street analysts were looking for Q2 EPS of $5.48 and revenue of $24.86 billion, according to Refinitiv.

wallstreetbet,"Wyckoff on the Meme's - Going into OPEXI am making this post to let everyone know my thoughts regarding the way that GME, AMC, and BBBY are positioned for tomorrow headed into Quad witching day. 

- Review of the Day

Compared to the broad market, all three stocks did very well. Individually, on the [daily chart](https://imgur.com/a/cRiMExm), GME is remaining immediately below it's volume shelf, AMC is actually just above it's volume shelf, and BBBY is struggling the most with multiple immediate deep volume shelves above it. 

What this means is that AMC is positioned the best (on the daily time frame), GME is positioned very well (especially considering the impressive manner with which it closed the day;  see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/0jCI)),
and BBBY is not far behind (considering it's rally into the close, as well; see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/Xle2Xoa)). 

Outside of this, as of yesterday, the skew for all of these tickers was indicating that they would likely face bearish sentiment (more positive value actually indicates more bearish sentiment). However, as of today, they are all [skewed](https://imgur.com/a/pWIgmS0)in favor of bullish sentiment. 

For those of you scratching your heads saying ""what does skew mean?"" It is a measure of the total implied volatility to both the upside and to the downside. So, if the total implied volatility tells you that a stock is likely to move wildly in a general direction, the skew tells you which direction that wild swing is likely to move toward. 

- What does all of this mean!? 

Ultimately, I suspect that the broad market is likely to remain flat or even perhaps ralley tomorrow given that it is Quad witching day, the [SPY](https://imgur.com/a/devHb64) rallied into the close, and that the price action naturally gravitates toward the point of control (POC; red line flowing from the strongest volume shelf). I suspect that this will serve to propel our beloved Meme Stocks toward Valhalla... All we have to do is break away from our own volume shelves, and then, they are gone! ü§û ü§∑

Let me know if anyone has any questions. I'm happy to help. I am learning alongside you and so, I appreciate you making me think critically. I welcome negative criticism. :)

Tl;Dr - Tomorrow's OPEX looks great for our Meme Stocks. The broad market is likely to remain flat or ralley tomorrow, thereby helping our movement."

Is quad witching day really going to do a whole lot? Honestly, probably not‚Ä¶ lets take a look at the last two days‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bxnhakxkg3o91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25574cda28a16ecb43202f5af11f7a8e98df3cd

June 17th (left side above) was a -0.22% close with a pretty much a range day with a total range of 369.38 to 362.17 for a $7.2 total movement. Note that this was the BOTTOM of the current 2022 bear market. 

March 18th (right side above) was a 0.78% green day with a range of 444.86 to 437.22 for about a $7.64 total movement. This was part of the March bull run. 

So looking at the only 2022 quad witching days we really don‚Äôt have enough info to say anything with certainty. However, the only thing that is a trend is that we could see about a $7 movement. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lfhjaxhlg3o91.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48f86414efefca2f6e3e9f6fd255ae13280db4a

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gt0tgaylg3o91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57dd6697e557394843cfb230d0d1198d448cc8a

There is an interesting 1, 2, 3, 4 move happening on SPY right now that is similar to the April to May sell off. The move was 1. Sell off, 2. Dead cat bounce, 3. Drop then consolidation, and followed by 4 bigger dump. Currently in that trend we are at 3 which is the 2nd drop and consolidation before the final third drop. If that is the pattern we are in and we can actually break through 390. 

Bears did make some progress today closing back below 390 and making a lower close under 390.5 avoiding a true double bottom. However, key 388.5 level was not breached today and was not closed under. Being that we have seen a close and plenty of movement around 390 and still managed to recover I would be really hesitant to be long on puts here until we can close a candle under 388.5 and make see a full candle close under that 391 level. 

Key support tomorrow is 388.5 -&gt; 386.2 (this is the 50% retracement line for the overall 2022 bear channel) -&gt; 385.2 -&gt; 382 -&gt; 378.7 (blue bear channel support) 

Key resistance- 391.1 -&gt; 393.1 -&gt; 395.4 -&gt; 397.8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m1q7p5img3o91.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79463c2e3df4ca729c4a463857046a59977796c2

SPY weekly actually is looking more bearish then the daily is. We did see that reconfigured support line from last week once again breached. That is very bearish going forward and we are also seeing that 390 support level tested. A close tomorrow below 390 would indicate that there is potential downside to be had next week. In addition, we currently have a bearish engulfing weekly candle. 

Key support- 390 -&gt; 380

Key resistance- 390 -&gt; 402 -&gt; 412

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8p22m80ng3o91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0595087227fc9d9483dc9f5857ca0f774646ef7

Futures does not look as bearish as SPY in my opinion with this candle hard rejection 3905 intraday today and continuing to hold that support. However we are seeing two full candles below the daily 8ema and that in and of itself is bearish. 

Key support- 3905 -&gt; 3867 -&gt; 3828 (blue bear channel support)

Key resistance- 3973 -&gt; 4006

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ja3z76ing3o91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad00766358819be89b94735d5dad8f6648d0234

We have not seen the futures weekly candle breach through support yet. However it is right at that key 3900 level and is well within reach of not only testing it but breaching and closing below it tomorrow and would complete the bearish weekly engulfing candle. 

Key support- 3900 -&gt; 3830 (black weekly bear channel support)

Key resistance- 4025 -&gt; 4100

If we were to see SPY close at or below 390  and futures at or below 3905 tomorrow to close out the weekly candle with a bearish engulfing candle and assuming the VIX can close over 26.9 I would be comfortable in some Friday DTE puts. However, you have to be careful as FOMC is Wednesday and that does usually leave to a bullish pump day. We have and could easily see Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday all be red days with Wednesday the long pump. IF you play weekly puts or even longer DTE puts I would recommend closing before FOMC and repositioning EOD of FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z7ib3l0og3o91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=883b81c86ca9c4bb6d6de81cf8b7c32d3803688f

Apple continues to show more weakness then spy does much like last week and two weeks ago before the big dead cat bounce. 

We saw apple make a new recent low and we saw a new recent low close. Closing below that key 153.8 level. There is potential for a retest of that level tomorrow and a rejection there would be a nice play on some puts both intraday and for next week. 

Key support- 151.5 -&gt; 149.7 -&gt; 147.9 (blue bear channel support)

Key resistance- 153.7 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qkvgj3kog3o91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9af3f2a115896d81991e717dcfedc439f6b2ce6

Apple to is working on a nice weekly bearish engulfing candle. A close below 152.7 would confirm the bearish engulfing candle and would insinuate more downside to come next week. 

Key support- 150.7 -&gt; 148.8 (black weekly bear chat)

Key resistance- 155.8

If apple manages to close EOD below 152.7 and definitely if we breach 150.7 with a close there would be a play for Friday DTE next week puts with again the same idea closing below FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g50kll3pg3o91.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eb6e33288debd8c63ea9a2c0c61aa0fb9cb06f6

VIX yet again continues to be detached from reality. We did touch 25.5 and that support held and we also touched 26.9 and that resistance held. The VIX with the doji finish is clearly undecided with which way it is going to go next. 

I still struggle and with my above plans struggle to recommend going long on puts or long on calls here until the vix really decides‚Ä¶ until vix breaks out over 26.9 and really closer to 28-30 its hard to believe in a sustained sell off. However, note that markets CAN sell off with the VIX remaining flat and even declining if there is no FEAR in the markets‚Ä¶ such as that markets agree in a sell off. I also struggle being long on calls until we can close under 25.5 and really start looking at 21-23. 

Overall for me‚Ä¶ I still do better with day trading then swings. 

10% challenge 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f2d73vkpg3o91.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23e0390bbaa3c6e9e03d502e9665647fe48a6c6

Overall today was a really good day. I was looking for a play this morning with the added volatility of the opening hour, however, by time I would see something I liked and would go get an order qued it already moved so fast and aggressive that there I felt like I was FOMOing and I refused to enter. Made all my trades before 1130 yesterday and today all came after 1130. 

Overall a good day and turning out to be a pretty good week trading wise. Looking forward to finishing the week strong tomorrow."

Depending and not depending, on what the extent of the subsidies this will make the Norwegian market bullish. It‚Äôs plausible that it even pays companies with long term contracts as it is likely to be a percentage of the spot price.

Explained in short terms, Norwegian industrial stocks are likely to make a jump.

Personal suggestions: ELKEM (ELK) REC Solar (RNWEF) Norsk hydro (NHYDY) Yara int (YARIY)

Make me proud and loose some money tomorrow. Currently it‚Äôs 1132 pm and the stock opens 0900 am, subsidies will first be announced 0100am CEST. So 0200 eat for the exchange and 0300 est for the  subsidies, lovely time to cry yourself to sleep afterwards."

While we assume that all oranges are orange in color because of their name, the fruit is often green when ripe, thanks to plenty of chlorophyll. In South America and other tropical locales, oranges are green year round. But in the U.S., where it's colder, oranges lose their chlorophyll and take on the color that matches their name. And because North American shoppers are [used to oranges](http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs195) that are actually orange, imported fruit is either exposed to ethylene gas or shocked with cold water in order to remove the chlorophyll."

1. buy buy Baby full or partial sale

Randy Johnson was slinging it sidearm.  This was my first warning sign.

Simply put, if you plot the location of each of these teams stadiums on a map of the US.  You start to see a pattern emerge.

If you plot each of these cities locations on a map, you can see they form two lines directly pointing to you guessed it - Bermuda! 

For those who don't know -  Bermuda is a British island territory in the North Atlantic Ocean known for its pink-sand beaches such as Elbow Beach and Horseshoe Bay.

wallstreetbet,"Welcome to my Journal Club. Drug DD - Schizophrenia Phase 3 DataTLDR: This is not the traditional DD you are used to reading. This is an in-depth look at medical research that supports a future event for the DD. I did a journal club on the material presented below. This is a new type of treatment. Here's a future play for you all. Karuna Therapeutics is very likely to get FDA approval from its phase 3 trial for KarXT. At this point, it's above my buy-in ability, so I'll let this one go and take what I got. 

Disclaimer: I'm not employed by Karuna Therapeutics. My research is my play. My career path is in medicine. You decide if you want to lose money by following me. I consider this unethical because I did a journal club on this. 

 Journal Clubs in the medical field are discussions about medical treatments on any published paper and test the person presenting the paper if they understand what's going on in the article. It requires the presenter to be very knowledgeable about the topic, including the interventions. Questions asked can be very difficult. Presentations are done in front of a room full of medical professionals. Medical professionals don't hold back on the questions. You can get your ass handed to you if you can't answer their questions, especially if it's one Doctor who's a top expert on a specific topic/disease state. It's the hot water situation. Journal Clubs are high-level discussion far above wallstreetbets pay grade. 

For the uninitiated with zero medical background. This type up I am doing because is going to have medical terms. I'll try my best to explain at the level of the general public.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing started with this published paper on which I had to do a journal club.

https://preview.redd.it/jbtta6eomhg91.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9526f8dc6a1ebcae1e1d9a74272b78b25677af2

Schizophrenia. This is a disease that is characterized by positive (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (lack of interest, motivation, desire, inability to feel pleasure). In other words, positive symptoms are symptoms that shouldn't be present in a normal person and negative symptoms are the emotions and cognitive functions not present in a normal functioning human being without schizophrenia. These symptoms are the result of what is called the Dopamine Hypothesis, where an imbalance of that neurotransmitter gives rise to symptoms of Schizophrenia. From what I learned about this disease state mechanistically. It's a result of too much dopamine released on neurotransmitters, so treating means dialing back the release, but I'm oversimplifying.

Currently, Schizophrenia is treated using guidlines such as the [2020 American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.books.9780890424841) (That's a direct link to the PDF file for that guideline). It discusses the assessment and treatment of schizophrenia. Current treatments in schizophrenia are divided between 1st generation (Typical Antipsychotics) and 2nd generation (Atypical Antipsychotics) medication classes of antipsychotics based on the mechanism of action. The mechanism of action of these drugs is important because it drives medical recommendations. 

* 1st generation antipsychotics (Haldol, Chlorpromazine/Thorazine, Loxapine, Mellaril, Prolixin) work on the dopamine pathways present in the brain to decrease dopamine neurotransmitters release (antagonizes D2 receptors) but cause unwanted side effects called extrapyramidal symptoms (akathisia, dystonia, dyskinesia, akinesia, parkinsonian, and Tardive Dyskinesia). Side effects are the reason these medications aren't tried first on patients presenting with symptoms of Schizophrenia in the usual cases.
* 2nd generation medications (Abilify, Rexulti, Vraylar, Zyprexa, Invega, and Seroquel) are considered first-line agents because there is enough clinical data to support the recommendation of these agents because it has fewer side effects and is more favorable compared to typical antipsychotics. 
* Another problem with antipsychotic medications is some cause more weight gain than others. 

[https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/publication/first-generation-antipsychotics-an-introduction-2110](https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/publication/first-generation-antipsychotics-an-introduction-2110)

[https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/publication/the-four-dopamine-pathways-relevant-to-antipsychotics-pharmacology-2096](https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/publication/the-four-dopamine-pathways-relevant-to-antipsychotics-pharmacology-2096)

&amp;#x200B;

I've given some background about the disease state. Now to go into the paper itself. For some patients, one antipsychotic isn't enough to control the symptoms of schizophrenia. Some patients may go through two trials of antipsychotics. If that doesn't work, patients get put on Clozapine, which is indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but clozapine has many side effects, and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program because of these side effects. Due to the current treatments for Schizophrenia, researchers have been looking for alternative pathways in the brain to treat the condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

The published paper in the NEJM: 

[Muscarinic Cholinergic Receptor Agonist and Peripheral Antagonist for Schizophrenia](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2017015)

This is a phase 2 study about the use of a combination of cholinergic/anticholinergic medication (KarXT) to treat Schizophrenia. The best part of this medication is zero activity affecting the Dopamine (D2) pathway. The two active ingredients are Xanomeline and Trospium. 

* Xanomeline is a centrally acting cholinergic agent that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier but has plenty of cholinergic side effects with zero dopamine pathway activation. Selective for the M1/M4 receptors. This agent has been trialed in Alzheimer's. M1 agonism may improve cognitive deficits, and M4 agonism may reduce psychotic symptoms. Xanomeline's mechanism of action decreases dopamine in the ventral tegmental area, which would decrease symptoms of schizophrenia. It also increases dopamine in the prefrontal cortex to improve cognition, and negative, and affective symptoms.
* Trospium is an M2/M3 peripheral antagonist FDA approved for overactive bladder with symptoms of urge incontinence. Due to the compound's tertiary amine group, it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Polarized compounds generally can't pass through the blood-brain barrier. They must be neutral in charge and lipophilic in nature.
* The combination of both agents, Trospium is added to Xanomeline to mitigate the cholinergic side effects of centrally acting muscarinic agents.
* The study took Xanomeline/Trospium (KarXT) and compared it against a placebo in patients with Schizophrenia over a 5-week trial.

The importance of that study is a statistically significant reduction of symptoms of Schizophrenia in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (PANSS - Gold Standard for antipsychotic clinical trials) between placebo and experimental agent over a 5-week period. The majority of side effects experienced in the experimental group KarXT were constipation, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. Only symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting decreased over time during the trial. Constipation remained in the experimental group over time. The downside to this trial is some patients do not tolerate the effect of KarXT hence the reason they drop out. 

There are medications that can be given to patients for constipation if the KarXT medication were to be dispensed as part of treatment for schizophrenia.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The realized trade I did because I knew the data from their phase 2 trial was so good it was going to pass the expectation of its phase 3 trial.

https://preview.redd.it/m7u7ke81khg91.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3aec00f498376a561bbba455d6b1d504e2b295f

What you see here is the realized play of Karuna Therapeutics a few days before they announced their Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 Results. I set a 9% trailing stop loss using past experience to know if the stock was going down further. That triggered. I was waiting for this company to release its data.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Today (8/8/2022), Karuna Therapeutics released the results of their Emergent-2 Trial for schizophrenia, and it went about as expected from what I expected when I read their published Phase 2 Trial article. 

https://preview.redd.it/d1azwy2hkhg91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22c4e1d00fe23c37d9695adf24dd46d41ec7e4f

 

&gt;*Trial met primary endpoint, with KarXT demonstrating a statistically significant 9.6-point reduction in PANSS Total Score compared to placebo at Week 5 (p&lt;0.0001)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Trial also met key secondary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, as measured by the PANSS positive, PANSS negative and PANSS negative Marder factor subscales*  
&gt;  
&gt;*KarXT was generally well tolerated, with a side effect profile substantially consistent with prior trials of KarXT in schizophrenia*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Company plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) with the* *U.S.* *Food &amp;* *Drug Administration* *(FDA) in mid-2023*

Want to know what the Inflation Reduction Act means for the market‚Äôs biggest companies, as well as for your wallet? When it comes to politics, you always have to follow the money ‚Äì and remember that the devil is in the details.

The Senate on Sunday passed the bill that‚Äôs designed to fight climate change, make significant tax changes, trim the federal deficit, cut drug prices for Medicare recipients and extend expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. As it moves to the House of Representatives, the roster of the winners and losers under the bill is coming into sharper focus even before it goes to President Joe Biden.

For both winners and losers, the impact is more modest than you would think, given the sheer size of the numbers being bandied about. That‚Äôs because of details like strings attached to some of the new or extended tax breaks, or the schedule for implementing Medicare‚Äôs negotiations with big pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.

Changes will be more gradual than many headlines imply.

Beginning with the biggest-dollar provisions of the 10-year package of spending and tax cuts, these are some of the effects American corporations and citizens will see from the law. The two biggest changes are the bill‚Äôs deficit reducers ‚Äì just two provisions of the law that account for 80% of its $300 billion in deficit reduction, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics.

Losers:

Big tax-avoiding corporations

Drug companies (but not as much as you think)

Public company shareholders

Winners:

wallstreetbet,"450k Gain from 2 years of tradinghttps://imgur.com/7SYTCm5
Total profits from all accounts before taxes is around 590k CAD (initial capital at around 170k)

During the two years, the buying power of the money probably reduced by 30%, plus the taxes that I had to pay, in the end I didn't make that much, still poor and couldn't afford housing. But on the bright side, I recovered from almost getting wiped out twice and learned some lessons that could only be learnt from painful losses.

My first post after I opened the first investment account:
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i75txe/yesterday_i_opened_my_first_investment_account/

I wrote a story of why I almost got wiped out:

Noah has this friend Ryan that recently came out as gay. Noah, a degenerated gambler, speculates that Ryan will get aids and die, so he bought life insurance on his friend hoping to collect premium when he dies. 

But nothing changed since Ryan came out, he still as lively as usual and shows no signs of dying. Noah starts to worry became the theta of Ryan's life insurance is costing him a lot over time, so he starts to have a second thought about this trade, maybe Ryan is using protection and won't get aids in the first place or maybe Ryan is just not getting laid enough.

As Noah's worries are mounting, Ryan suddenly became very sick, at this point, Noah knew that he was right all along, so he doubled down on life insurances. However, just a few days later, Ryan recovered, and it seems like it was just a bad case of flu. But Noah knew better, he knew that the flu is just the first symptom that appears, and now all he has to do is wait.

A few year passed, and nothing really changed, Noah is down a lot on his speculative investment and starts to worry again, he did some more research and found out some HIV patients will have incubation period of 10 years. He also worried that Ryan may already knew that he was infected and is on drug already, if that is the case, then all of his efforts are in vain.

But Noah isn't going to give up, because he was down too much already, he has no money to buy more and he is struggling to pay the current premiums. Unfortunately for him, things just keep getting worse. He lost his job in a sudden and now he can't even make ends meet, let alone keeping up with the insurance payments. 

And of course, unsurprisingly, as soon as Noah could no longer afford the payments, Ryan was killed in a car accident. As it turns out, it was Noah's insurances that kept Ryan alive all these years.

Anyways, surviving 2 yrs in the market is a big deal to me, because I heard most traders give up after a year or two. Then the rest gives up after 5 years. I know that my opinion about the market has changed completely. After the ups and downs, I feel like I know what I am doing, but that happened a couple of times already, both times didn't end well, I sure hope this time is different.

If there is one piece of advice that everyone should keep in mind at all time, is that when the market doesn't go your way, remember it's you that are irrational, never the market."

  Marijuana MSO Parallel faces financial hurdles after $1.9B SPAC deal collapses

Jeff Smith, Legal &amp; Regulatory Reporter

**August 8, 2022**

  

**Now, Wrigley, Atlanta-based Parallel and some of its top executives face litigation ‚Äì including a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in southern Florida by investors alleging securities fraud, mismanagement and misrepresentation.**

  Among other things, the three disgruntled investment groups accuse Wrigley of deliberately letting the SPAC deal ‚Äúdie on the vine‚Äù when it was clear the merged company would fail to live up to expectations.

They also accuse Wrigley of spending their investment on servicing debt rather than on company operations.

The plaintiffs are seeking a minimum of $25 million in damages plus expenses.

But in a recent motion to dismiss, Parallel and other defendants reject the allegations, saying the case doesn‚Äôt involve fraud but rather ‚Äúdisappointed investors.‚Äù

 In Parallel‚Äôs case, court filings, investor presentations and other disclosures reflect a company that trumpeted lofty ambitions but struggled under the weight of massive debt and unrealized growth projections.

For example:

&amp;#x200B;

* In      August 2021, Parallel ‚Äì which also does business in some states as      Surterra Wellness ‚Äì projected its 2022 revenue would be $618 million. But      by January of this year, the company had slashed that projection by 40%,      to $362 million.
* Parallel      struggled to have enough cash to avoid defaulting on $350 million in debt.
* Even      before the SPAC deal was announced, Parallel had posted net losses of      $263 million in 2019 and $140 million in 2020.

After the Scooter Braun deal unraveled, court filings indicate that Parallel told the investors it was pursuing a sale of the company that would be completed by mid-2022. That also hasn‚Äôt materialized.

Parallel declined to comment to *MJBizDaily* about the litigation, its current financial condition and whether the company is for sale.

A wide majority (83%) of shoppers said inflation impacted their purchases, with one-third of those Numerator surveyed saying they waited for the Prime Day sales.

wallstreetbet,"The Recent Sri Lanka Collapse Is a Perfect Example As To Why Powell/Biden Will Crash Markets To Kill InflationI swear, everyone is fucking retarded from 10 years of QE cocaine injected straight into their nostrils. We are seeing first hand the drastic effects of untamed monetary policy and what specifically happens to the people that are in charge during this time. Sri Lanka is in shambles and its leadership has fled in exile. 

Think about it, would you want to be the guy sitting in the hot seat when things go to shit? I'm sure you all have seen the video of the Sri Lanka rioters storming the central bank. Imagine being Powell or whatever other nation counterpart like ECB sitting in the bosses seat while people storm the building. This is further exasperated in what happens to the President, Biden does not want to be the guy holding the inflation bag. 

So, currently, the Fed and Biden administration are totally fine with beating a horse to death multiple times as long as price stability is intact. Powell has also said it about a million times that his definition of a soft landing is keeping a strong labor market while returning to price stability, and he just got a steaming hot market served up to him. Whilst the asset market is being a hard betting that he will pivot soonest chance he gets. Thus, the markets screaming ""whip me papa"" for a 100bps increase. 

Obviously, Sri Lanka and U.S. are two completely different beasts but the general thread of inflation leaves a grime reality if it can't be defeated. Think for a minute, if you have a grandma or any other family member looking to retire and see their wealth just get halved by inflation while returns are negative, I guarantee you those fuckers are gonna be boiling for a scapegoat and willing for leadership overhaul."

&amp;#x200B;

**FED last FOMC MEETING:**

From this, see the below most important pieces:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIK9UogQBjE&amp;ab\_channel=FederalReserve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIK9UogQBjE&amp;ab_channel=FederalReserve)

\- 12:02  FED Looking for ""compelling evidence that inflation is moving back down"" in **a ""series of declining monthly inflation""   (no theoretical bullshit** that this was the peak, but SERIES of declining monthly inflation rates)

\- 13:10 **We're doing FRONT END LOADING of the end rate** (meaning we pack the big hikes first before recession is declared officially and middterms come closer)

\- 18:22 **Models are bad, we¬¥re going to find out empirically what the rate is**, we just care about data not political excuses

\- 20:45 If you saw another tick up would you do 100bps? JPOW: we'll react to the incoming data when it does (meaning yes?)

\- 50:30 the last decades we had tremendous deflationary forces that are no longer there, the current forces are different, models are old and no workting in this environment, we want to see the data and react to it(redundant to the above, no bullshit political about the future, just show me the cpi going down several months)

&amp;#x200B;

**Jobs (the other Fed mandate):**

They are very strong for now, it was VERY clear, this provides cover for higher rates:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/08/jobs-report-june-2022-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/08/jobs-report-june-2022-.html)

&amp;#x200B;

**Markets:**

Already 51% analysts expect 100-125 bps, up from 9% yesterday, and 7% just 2 days ago... This tells us THE MARKET HAS NOT YET PRICED IN FULLY the 50% chance of 100bps, it only started doing this today, retail in particular only now hearing about this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

**GDP 2nd quarter + recession + FOMC dates:**

Recession is expected as 2nd quarter will also contract like the 1st: [https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#:\~:text=The%20GDPNow%20model%20estimate%20for,1.9%20percent%20on%20July%207](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#:~:text=The%20GDPNow%20model%20estimate%20for,1.9%20percent%20on%20July%207).

Official release by 28th of JULY: [https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule)

FOMC DATE 27th JULY:

# CONCLUSION AND TL;DR:

1) FOMC ANOUNCEMENT **27th of JULY**

2) Gross Domestic Product, 2nd Quarter 2022 (Advance Estimate) **July 28th...** 

Do you see it now?

This means that the official recession will be declared THE DAY AFTER FOMC, meaning this will be the **last chance they have to be very agressive and do thie FRONT END LOADING.**.. before they get all the political preasures of having caused a recession... 

So 100 BPS seems very likely, maybe even 125 BPS if the market prices in 100 in 1 week? The fed made the market price in 25 more bops last time just a day before fomc, remember? so if we get used to 100 this week, we can get used to 125 next...

So, are we getting 2 weeks of downward preassure with war which may be going to new levels, guidance adjustments, earnings, fomc and recession fears while we price in 100-125 bps? You be the judge"

wallstreetbet,"Biden prediction that inflation hit 'peak' in December coming back to haunt him Inflation rose 9.1% in June, 6 months after Biden said 'it‚Äôs the peak of the crisis'

Six months after President Biden said inflation hit its peak, the consumer price index hit a new 40-year high, according to a new Labor Department report released Wednesday.

The consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago, marking the fastest increase since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive, suggesting that inflation may not be near its peak: Energy prices rose 7.5% in June from the previous month, and are up 41.6% from last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk and fresh vegetables. 

**BIDEN, WHITE HOUSE BLAME EVERYTHING FROM GOVERNMENT SPENDING FOR INFLATION**

In December, when inflation was still at 6.8%, Biden told reporters that ""it‚Äôs the peak of the crisis"" and, ""you‚Äôll see it change sooner, quicker, more rapidly than people think.""

The president's comments at the time came several days after Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that ""factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into"" 2022.

Powell's testimony followed months of the White House painting the skyrocketing inflation as ""transitory"" and predicting it would come back down in 2022. The numbers have continued to rise, however, and the Federal Reserve has been forced to take a more hawkish approach by raising interest rates. Last month, in the third interest rate hike of 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points, the largest rate hike since 1994.

I need to find a different scan setup soon before I give up on trading. Here is my main TI scanner set up:

Im looking to build a new scan that finds stocks that are trending up on the daily chart. Stocks where I can go long and not have to worry about so many bull-traps and a more consistent trend. I‚Äôm guessing those types of stocks are higher float and move a lot less % wise, correct?

Can you point me in the right direction for the type of (alert) &amp; (filters) to find these types of stocks?

I feel like I‚Äôm good at TA, reading the 1M,5M,1D charts but with trading these low-float stocks I notice the exact millisecond I enter in a trade it goes the other direction sometimes. I also feel like the algos stop-hunt me.

So what‚Äôs the move? I don‚Äôt really understand what is happening other than inflation is high, euro is worth more than a dollar, and that something major will happen because of today‚Äôs news. 

I will also not blindly follow any advice given, just interested in reading some ideas of what to do with future plans. I also know this isn‚Äôt an advice sub, but you folks are way more entertaining with your answers."

The S&amp;P 500 $SPY is down 0.78% as traders price in the possibility of a more aggressive interest rate hike. Do you think inflation has peaked in the US?

Shoppers paid sharply higher prices for a variety of goods in June as inflation kept its hold on a slowing U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.

The consumer price index, a broad measure of everyday goods and services related to the cost of living, soared 9.1% from a year ago, above the 8.8% Dow Jones estimate. That marked another month of the fastest pace for inflation going back to December 1981.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI increased 5.9%, compared with the 5.7% estimate. Core inflation peaked at 6.5% in March and has been nudging down since.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI rose 1.3% and core CPI was up 0.7%, compared to respective estimates of 1.1% and 0.5%.

Taken together, the numbers seemed to counter the narrative that inflation may be peaking, as the gains were based across a variety of categories.

However, I was expecting that if CPI was predicted as being 8.8% and then the ACTUAL CPI is an ever bigger jump (9.1%) this would signal a cooling off for USD and a drop in its value. If inflation worries is what‚Äôs driving the value of the Euro down, surely rising inflation in the US would also dent the value of USD no?

Instead, with the CPI released, USD has become massively Bullish???

Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 9.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.  The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food being the largest contributors. The energy index rose 7.5 percent over the month and contributed nearly half of the all items increase, with the gasoline index rising 11.2 percent and the other major component indexes also rising. The food index rose 1.0 percent in June, as did the food at home index.   The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7 percent in June, after increasing 0.6 percent in the preceding two months. While almost all major component indexes increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, and new vehicles. The indexes for motor vehicle repair, apparel, household furnishings and operations, and recreation also increased in June. Among the few major component indexes to decline in June were lodging away from home and airline fares.  The all items index increased 9.1 percent for the 12 months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1981. The all items less food and energy index rose 5.9 percent over the last 12 months.

‚ÄòIncreasingly outlandish‚Äô

Twitter filed a much-anticipated lawsuit yesterday as it looks to force Elon Musk to close his $44 billion acquisition of the company. Twitter argues that it has every right to do so under a specific performance provision in the deal contract.

The company, with the help of lawyers at Wachtell (which has also worked for Musk), set fire to Musk‚Äôs efforts to drop the bid, which it argued were more about the drop in Tesla‚Äôs shares and its effect on Musk‚Äôs wealth than anything else.

‚ÄúMusk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,‚Äù the company said in the suit, adding: ‚ÄúMusk apparently believes that he ‚Äî unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law ‚Äî is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.‚Äù (Musk has not responded to a request for comment.)

Here is what else Twitter said:

The company gave Musk everything and more on spam accounts, contrary to Musk‚Äôs claims that Twitter stonewalled his efforts to get the information he needed to close the deal. But even then, Twitter claims, Musk‚Äôs demands became progressively more irrational.

‚ÄúFrom the outset, defendants‚Äô information requests were designed to try to tank the deal,‚Äù the lawsuit reads. ‚ÄúMusk‚Äôs increasingly outlandish requests reflect not a genuine examination of Twitter‚Äôs processes but a litigation-driven campaign to try to create a record of noncooperation on Twitter‚Äôs part.‚Äù

Bots do not count as a ‚Äúmaterial adverse effect‚Äù that would justify canceling the deal, despite Musk‚Äôs claims that Twitter‚Äôs regulatory disclosures, which state that about 5 percent of its accounts are bots, were intentionally misleading. Twitter explicitly said in its regulatory filings that the figures were estimates. And Musk cited fixing the problem of spammers and bots as a primary reason he wanted to buy Twitter, according to the suit.

On April 9, the day Musk said he wanted to acquire Twitter rather than join its board, he texted Twitter‚Äôs chairman, Bret Taylor, to say ‚Äú‚Äòpurging fake users‚Äô from the platform had to be done in the context of a private company because he believed it would ‚Äòmake the numbers look terrible,‚Äô‚Äù the suit reads.

Twitter ran its business in ‚Äúordinary course,‚Äù meaning consistent with how it previously ran things. Breaking an ‚Äúordinary course‚Äù provision has gotten a buyer out of a deal before, notably AB Stable‚Äôs acquisition of MAPS Hotels and Resorts during the height of the pandemic. Musk accused Twitter of breaking its ordinary course when it, among other things, slowed hiring and fired two executives without telling him.

1. Your Life Expectancy 
2. Willingness to hold for long periods of red seas.
3. The company must have some if not all of the following ;  meangiful cash, zero to unmeangiful  debt, projected quarter to quarter growth, zero  or way ahead of  competition, 
4. Favorable Geo Political environments with policies directly effecting  the investment.  
_ Ray Dalio mentions the rising threat, one of the principles is the rise of heat fall of every empire. 

First it is t he creation of a lot of debt and the printing of

The second is the amount of internal conflict arising from the largest wealth-gaps and the largest political gaps since 1900.¬†

Third, the rising of a great power to challenge an existing great power to compete with in the form of China challenging the United States. 


What i belive Ray Dalio fails to mention is the following; 

The rise of a new power as he teaches in his book typically occurs after a great battle or war is won.  A war with China is the end of civilization,  in past history the emerging threats where never fought through the lenses of nuclear capabilities. Also the new world emerging power after wining the battle must control its people, it is hard to  proove that any system outside of capitalism has ever been recorded to ever be better.  Capitalism and democracy is not perfect, one must consider the  lack of better alternative.   that has ever worked or advanced society.

wallstreetbet,"Recent economic news and data, I think, would make the Fed more cautious about rate hikeRecent economic news and data sent out contradictory pictures regarding the outlooks of the economy which, I think, would make the Fed more cautious about rate hike rather than becoming hawkish. I think there is an increasing chance that the market may nearly or about to bottom off.

Yesterday (3rd Jun), the market again dropped after strong job report. Many analysts argue that the strong Friday job data would give the Fed more room to hike rates further, which sent the market down on Friday close. However, I‚Äôm looking at it differently, job data is a lagging indicator which only tells you what happened over last month or previous a few months. I believe a comprehensive consideration regarding all the recent news apart from the job report is necessary. 

Very recently, we have more and more corporates America voicing out the concerns of their earnings expectations and the border economy such as Musk and Jamie Dimon etc. In the meantime, Walmart reported inventory surge and cut its profit outlook and several IT giants reporting low revenues forecast as well. In addition, OPEC+ is going to boost oil production by 50%. More importantly, several Fed chairs are softening their tones regarding rapid rate hikes. 

If we take all the above into consideration, job data is a lagging indicator, whereas corporate forecast or expectation is a leading indicator. It is very clear which indictor we should follow if we think proactively. I‚Äôm guess this is why the Fed is softening their tones. 

As a result, I‚Äôm actually becoming more optimistic about the current market conditions. However, an economy recession is now the biggest risk we need to warry about. A soft landing is ideal for everyone meaning some job loss plus some bankrupts. However, this is very difficult for the Fed to control the extent. Anyway, reason that I‚Äôm being optimistic is whenever there is a recession, the Fed needs to lower the rates and print money again. This is just an ever-ending credit cycle.  

Anyway, I‚Äôm a long-term investor who like to take some risk. My strategy and opinion not suitable for short-term traders."

First, credit to u/Tiny_Yulius_James for his [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v4a9tb/gme_is_unshortable_at_ibkr_57025475_votes_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Can‚Äôt believe I missed this. It was so obvious. Kid needed help writing a post though and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen it brought up. 

Second, the SEC still hasn‚Äôt said shit back to the retail outrage so here‚Äôs some ‚Äúresearch‚Äù for them on their favorite meme stock. 

Here‚Äôs GME 8k filing. Look at the votes. [8-k](https://investor.gamestop.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001326380-22-000080)

GME has a free float of 63.98 mil. Total shares 76-ish mil. 

The 8k Tallies roughly 57,000,000 votes, and another 10,000,000+ that didn‚Äôt vote. That puts total shareholders more than the free float. 

Last time I checked the short shares were 28% of the float. See I may be a dumb ape, but I‚Äôm just not seeing how that math adds up without them being naked short again. Naked short (short more than available shares). Man these little crooks are trying to hide this so hard. Do they really not know how to make money without cheating? Hahaha.

I mean, it‚Äôs not like we didn‚Äôt know, but now you really know. What if all the attention on the vote was just to expose this? 

I know shills are going to shill hard on this.  Fuck em.

wallstreetbet,"Spotlight on a 2x Leveraged ETF FNGG-Holdings are Worth Taking a Look AtFNGG is a 2x leveraged ETF that gives you the advantage of taking out margin on your broker without actually taking out margin, and it accurately tracks the price of some very interesting holdings with 2x the volatility.  I think we hit the market bottom so I am personally all in on FNGG.  What is interesting are the holdings:

I like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:

I would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.

At the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.

One man has the power to tank the market‚Ä¶ love to see it. Actually its quite comical if you think about it that the market tanked on MSFT earnings forecast adjustment and then recovered but this was the nail in the coffin‚Ä¶ Good stuff.

Bulls are pretty much do or die here though as they are back at the support line. Markets stayed pinned almost all day from 1015 am between 412.2 and 409.9. That 409.9 support was hella strong and is something to watch next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gz7cffm70h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8eb70e04adf3bda2630e2c6b3ad82e42f364ac2

The daily is really tough to get a read on here. We held that key 409.5 support today which also means we once again held the daily 8ema which is seen as bullish. The daily 8ema is now confirmed above the daily 20ema. With yesterdays big green finish and the bullishly engulfing candle we very well should have seen 420s today. However, with that market FUD this morning we took a nose dive seeing our first 1.5% red day since May 18th. 

Seeing only one bull day followed up by a bear day we should suspect to see a follow up red day Monday based off the trend. 

Bull case- Bulls need a massive gap up Monday at open to maintain the integrity of the channel. The bulls would need to open near 412.5 in order to hold support of channel and from there see nothing but green. 

Bears as long as we open under 412.5 will see this channel support broken. From there they will look to tackle the 409.9 support that just did not want to break today. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX maintains its downward trend since May 20th and as long as this downward trend continues their should be further upside for SPY. However, today the VIX pretty much just sputtered between 42.9 and 25.9 all day long. The VIX was very much so disconnected from the market today.

I don‚Äôt really speak on volume much in my nightly TA but intraday I heavily rely on VOLSPD and VOLD to guide my trades. Today pretty much all day long both made new lows over and over. When volume is that bearish SPY should be following. We also saw pretty aggressive sell pressure from pretty much open to close yet we did not have the type of follow through on SPY price action wise. Today was a very odd day intraday. Pretty much every candle inversed itself and there was no continuation of trends or candles. It was very choppy. There was 11 (the most ive seen yet) 180 reversals of price action today. With he VIX under 25 that‚Äôs unnatural that‚Äôs some VIX 30+ level stuff right there. Today overall was a very odd day. It seemed like the Markets were propping it up EOD that 409.9 should have been busted through easily.

We officially are back to red weekly candles with this close now. We are also seeing that this candle failed to break the weekly 8ema. Weekly wise major support at 406 and major resistance at 415.

Earlier in the week I mentioned that Apple had a gap still well it ALMOST filled it all today‚Ä¶ gap left is 144.34 to 144.46.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dolx0zca0h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38636ceaa0877c0db677ff4a48ec6ecc33e8530a

QQQ actually looked extremely strong today despite the rest of the market and actually still has its GAP to be filled from 300.92 to 302.42. 

There is a very likely scenario where we see these both filled on Monday which would mean SPY will break through that 409.9 support. 

Overall I usually have a sense of direction going into the next week but I really have no idea where they are going to take this next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have the big CPI on Friday its pretty expected to think we will see some chop leading up to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iqxgb4cb0h391.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dad5a54d8b9a984966f41d01b1b3aa74e03d498

Looking at the last few CPI you can see the two days leading up to the release of CPI have historically been VERY bearish especially if you look at the May and April release dates. Also the last 4 CPI release days have been a red day themselves. The way these fed members have been speaking this weak I am not expecting a beat at all on this CPI. I highly expect it to be a big miss. 

10% challenge-

I went into today with secured weekly profits. I got impatient and made a very costly trade on calls in the morning on one of the fake outs. From there it just never quite got better. I made an EOD put trade that I failed to secure profits on out of pure greed thinking that we would FINALLY break through 409.9 and ended up closing if for a fairly large loss. Through good and through bad im here and im transparent with you guys. Today was a bad day for me. But I look forward to money and starting fresh with a full 5 days. I don‚Äôt need to make up for these losses all on Monday. I have plenty of time to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw that Mr. Burns looking moron give an interview lying through his crooked, yellow, rotten teeth about how this is meant to protect the consumer against risky investments. 

So if an investment is risky it constitutes it as a meme? If so, is 90% of tech a meme? Netflix is down from 700 to 200, is that a meme? How about Paypal being down from 300 to 80? Both a part of a long line of profitable and sustainable tech companies that have possibly cost some investors a much larger absolute amount/percentage than what the SEC calls a meme. 

My idiot cousin, who ""works"" as a broker, said it's easy to know what a meme is...just look at WSB and whatever has a bunch of memes about it is a meme. So if we post memes about apple, microsoft, amazon, and other blue chips do they become memes? Will the SEC put them in that category too?

This isn't just idiotic, it's corrupt and very dangerous. The government body meant to ensure the legal trade of securities in this country is actively picking and choosing which stocks to put in a shitbasket called memes. This is literally a government agency telling people which stocks not to buy...based on zero rationale.

The only meme here is that these morons take home a nice salary, get health insurance, and a pension off of our tax dollars."

And of course you need to deal with that whole Congressional theater / digital rights shit show.   You then find out a company that possesses arguably the best tech marketing on the planet is about to announce a VR/AR headset at their next WWC event in a month or so.  You ask around how real it could be. You find out said company has a twenty plus year development cycle supporting VR and AR on their proprietary very complete echosystem /platform. Even their decades old OS-X - a child of the NextStep OS that supported Pixar's Renderman -  has VR/AR/CGI hooks.  You realize that software wise they could already be ahead. Ah but hardware? Oh a VR/AR headset is a glorified cellphone with secret sauce? Oh and they redefined the cellphone and made the device that people rave about already?  They can even just announce a new color and people lose their shit. Yikes. And you say they have marketing that can crush you and not break a sweat.  Whereas your marketing does not seem to land? Crap - any upside?  Well the ignorant stock analyst will suddenly change their tune about the whole metasphere because its less about what you say than how you say it and WHO says it. Because, you know, stock market analysts have the attention span of Doug - ""Squirrel!""  But then the digital rights thing - crap they are crushing you with their ad campaign about protecting your personal data and our ad campaign - oh wait - did we forget to do an ad campaign?  -  Well anything else positive? Well they never start a price war. They will not fight you to the bottom. So you can expect them to come out higher, possibly much higher. Phew that's a relief.  But did I mentioned their userbase will pay any price to have their products that fit in their ecosystem? That owning one will be the definition of cool and to not own one will be the definition of a loser? Oh and if it supports remote learning - parents will pay any price. It may be a killer app?

There was a lawsuit against Tenneco for investigation into possible breach of fiduciary duties in connection  with the sale of TEN to affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. for  $20.00 in cash per share of TEN owned.

I joined in on this lawsuit, and my lawyer got in touch with me today and all other share holders to inform of good news that Tenneco withheld some information, or wasnt quite honest with everything they were saying, or what they were supposed to be doing.  However, what was made transparent now will leave the shareholders more at ease in making their vote on June 7th to agree to the amount of 20 dollars per share.

There is not risk of early assignment for a bought call option. Only for the sold option. When I checked later, the bid/ask spread had these valued at easily $225 each, meaning missed out on $1600 simply because Fidelity would not let me risk $200 of my own money, even utilizing settled cash.

Chat with Fidelity (my responses bold):

 **I have a question about my account e.g., moving money, investments, etc.**  


*Please share some details so a representative can best support you.*

**I was denied the ability to buy call options expiring today.**

Please wait a minute while I connect you with a live chat representative. There may be a brief delay before the chat appears.

**Fidelity restricts certain opening option transactions to prevent exercise and assignment risk. Opening orders for options that expire that day are not accepted. Options for this security that do not expire today are eligible to trade."" - there is not exercise assignment risk if I am the long holder of a call option. This is ridiculous and costed me $1200 of profit. I know how to manage option risk.**

Thank you for contacting Fidelity Investments. My name is Hannah. I understand you may have has issues placing a trade. One moment while I review your messages

**Is there anyway to remove this restriction?**

Unfortunately, this is not a restriction that can be removed. I do apologize for any inconvenience. I will, however, submit you message as feedback

**Thank you. Anticipate many users leaving Fidelity for brokers that do not have this restriction.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

Fidelity fucks. They restrict us from risking our own money where there is no risk - max loss of $200 which I have settled cash for in my account. They ""cannot remove this restriction."" It would make sense on selling a last day call, but not buying one."

As expected, price moved heavy to the upside on volume. Shorts have reloaded once volume started dropping off midday. According to fintel, there's only 20k shares available to short (was previously over 500k). Float is only at 1.7m. Based on this, I assume the float is 20-30% SHORT. If we get enough buy volume, shorts will be forced to cover and this will send the stock FLYING. Let's get the word out!

LADIES AND GENTS

I PRESENT TO YOU THE NEXT BIG DESPAC REVERSAL TRADE:

$SBIG was formerly $TCAC.

You may be familiar with all of the despac squeezes that have been happening recently, if you haven‚Äôt, please go see: PGY, CMRA, MSPR, BOXD, list goes on.

$PGY ran 400% this week, from $2.75 to over $14 after people discovered the final float numbers from the merger on Tuesday.

The PGY float was 944,877.

SBIG is also another highly redeemed despac.

Per their 8-K filing on 6/21: ‚ÄúHolders of an aggregate of 19,123,806 Class A ordinary shares of Tuatara sold in its initial public offering (the ‚ÄúIPO‚Äù) (such shares, the ‚ÄúPublic Shares‚Äù) properly exercised their right to have such shares redeemed for a full pro rata portion of the trust account holding the proceeds from Tuatara‚Äôs IPO‚Äù

At IPO there were 20,000,000 units of common stock. If you do the math, this leaves a free float of 876,194. The reason it did not take off here is because at the merger there was a 1:1 bonus share added to the float immediately which effectively doubled the float making it 1,752,388. These bonus shares of course immediately caused a massive dilution selloff and that brings us to where we are now.

PGY‚Äôs with a float of 944,877 gives it a market cap by free float of exactly $2.6m at $2.75.

SBIG with a float of 1,752,388 gives it a market cap by free float of \~1.9m at $1.75.

Now just take a look at the charts.

wallstreetbet,"Walmart (WMT) cut its second quarter outlook, saying earnings would miss expectationsAfter the market close yesterday, the company cut its second quarter outlook, saying earnings would miss expectations as the retail giant ramps up discounts amid a softening consumer outlook.

""The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend, and while we‚Äôve made good progress clearing hardline categories, apparel in Walmart U.S. is requiring more markdown dollars,"" CEO Doug McMillon said Monday. ""We‚Äôre now anticipating more pressure on general merchandise in the back half \[of the year\].""

Back in May, Walmart and Target (TGT) sparked fears about the health of the consumer after both companies flagged bloated inventories and cautious customers.

And though the market's recent rally might suggest investors getting past these fears, the bad news from smaller brands like Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI) and Weber (WEBR) we've seen in recent days serve as a reminder ‚Äî when retail giants sneeze, smaller players are going to catch a cold.

""Net Sales performance was affected by slower retail traffic, both in-store and online, in all key markets, as well as continued foreign currency devaluations that impact our reported results,"" Weber said in a press release Monday morning.

""Management believes that the slower retail traffic patterns are the result of pressured consumer shopping behaviors globally, due to rising inflation, supply chain constraints, fuel prices, and geopolitical uncertainty. The Company expects these market headwinds to continue into the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.""

Moving into 2022, fundamentals of (some) Chinese equities remain relatively cheap compared to earnings growth if recession is factored in. Global contagion from recession is likely to affect China with them being the one of the largest holder of US debt. 

However, secular bets could be still placed in certain equities or sectors of the China's market as the CCP looks to support their economy.

wallstreetbet,"Amazon blames inflation as it increases cost of Prime in Europe - FTAmazon is increasing prices for its Prime membership scheme across its major European markets, several months after raising fees for US customers, in a move intended to offset the ecommerce giant‚Äôs operating costs.

In Germany, Amazon‚Äôs biggest market outside of the US, membership costs will increase 30 per cent, while Prime members in France will pay 43 per cent more for perks such as faster delivery and Amazon‚Äôs online entertainment. Increases will also be applied in Spain and Italy.

The increases are steeper than the 17 per cent jump in the Prime membership price that came into effect for new US subscribers in February.

For UK customers the price of an annual subscription will increase 20 per cent from ¬£79 to ¬£95 a year. The price will go from ¬£7.99 to ¬£8.99 per month for those paying in monthly instalments.

A spokesperson attributed the move to ‚Äúincreased inflation and operating costs‚Äù. The changes will go into effect on September 15.

An Amazon spokesperson noted it was the first time since 2014 the company had raised the cost of Prime in the UK. According to research group Insider Intelligence, the UK has at least 27mn Prime members. It estimated that penetration among the UK population surpassed 50 per cent in 2021. It projects 32.2mn Prime subscribers in the UK by 2024.

Amazon had not previously confirmed plans to implement Prime price rises outside of the US.

‚ÄúAmazon raising the price of Prime membership is unsurprising given recent inflation ‚Äî and that it already pulled this lever in the US six months ago,‚Äù said Andrew Lipsman from Insider Intelligence. ‚ÄúWhile the timing of this price hike will be met with more grumbles than it would‚Äôve been in February, consumers will ultimately shrug off the increase since Prime remains a great value.‚Äù

The price increase comes as the $1.2tn ecommerce and cloud giant faces soaring costs in its retail business ‚Äî a result of supply chain strains, overstaffing and an overexpansion of warehousing space during the coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, Amazon is spending big on acquiring content for Prime Video, its answer to Netflix. The company has splashed out on rights to broadcast Premier League and Champions League football, as well as the creation of a new Lord of The Rings TV series. Earlier this year Amazon closed its $8.45bn deal to take over film studio MGM.

Prime members are crucial to driving Amazon‚Äôs profit margins, as they typically spend more money on the site, and shop more often, than regular customers. But the principle attraction ‚Äî free delivery within one or two days ‚Äî has become increasingly expensive for the company to maintain as the price of fuel and other costs has rocketed.

After going through much of the peak pandemic period soaking up much of that pressure, the company has more recently started passing on some costs to sellers and customers. In addition to the Prime price rise in the US, in April it instituted a 5 per cent fuel surcharge on deliveries in that country.

Operating costs for Amazon‚Äôs international business ‚Äî excluding its AWS cloud division ‚Äî increased in the January-March period from $29.4bn to $30bn, with the segment swinging from a $1.3bn operating profit for the quarter in 2021 to a $1.3bn loss in 2022.

In the same period, global sales on Amazon‚Äôs online store fell from $52.9bn to $51.1bn.

Amazon is set to report earnings for the April-June period on Thursday. Its stock is down by more than 30 per cent since the start of the year, part of the broader sell off of Big Tech stocks.

On Monday, Amazon‚Äôs shares fell around 4 per cent in after-hours trading following a profit warning from Walmart, its primary retail competitor in the US. Walmart said inflation was hurting its shoppers and predicted adjusted earnings per share for the full year would decline as much as 13 per cent. Shares in other retailers, such as Target and Costco, also fell on the warning.

SHANGHAI, July 26 (Reuters) - Alibaba [**(9988.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/9988.HK) will apply for a primary listing in Hong Kong and keep its U.S. listing, the first big company to take advantage of a rule change allowing high-tech Chinese firms with dual class shares to seek dual primary listings in Hong Kong.

The e-commerce giant's move, announced on Tuesday, comes as both Washington and Beijing sharpen scrutiny over Chinese companies' listings, and after a devastating regulatory crackdown in China left Alibaba with a $2.8 billion fine and scuppered an initial public offering (IPO) of its affiliate Ant.

&amp;#x200B;

Alibaba's stock jumped 4% at the start of trading in Hong Kong as analysts said the change should give mainland China investors easier access to the shares via a link to the Hong Kong bourse known as the Stock Connect. At 0303 GMT, the shares were up 5% while the Hong Kong benchmark [**(.HSI)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.HSI) was up 1.2%.

Already present on the Hong Kong bourse with a secondary listing since 2019, Alibaba said it expects the primary listing to be completed by the end of 2022. Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said the dual listing would foster a ""wider and more diversified investor base"".

&amp;#x200B;

The move comes after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in January changed its rules to allow ""innovative"" Chinese companies - operating an internet or other high-tech business - with weighted voting rights or variable interest entities (VIE) to carry out dual primary listings in the city.

Under a VIE structure, a Chinese company sets up an offshore entity for overseas listing purposes that allows foreign investors to buy into the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hong Kong is also the launch pad for Alibaba's globalisation strategy, and we are fully confident in China's economy and future,"" Alibaba's CEO Zhang said in a statement.

## SWEEPING CRACKDOWN

Alibaba listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014, marking what was at the time the largest IPO in history.

Since 2020, the company's share price has tanked in both markets, as a sweeping regulatory crackdown by Beijing has battered Chinese tech companies.

At the same time, U.S. regulators have stepped up scrutiny of accounts of Chinese firms listed in New York, demanding greater transparency.

While broad in scope, a core focus of China's crackdown has been regulators seeking to expand oversight of public offerings.

Last year, Chinese authorities launched a probe into ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing just after it listed in New York, citing data privacy concerns.

The company later de-listed and began preparations to list in Hong Kong, leading analysts to interpret the probe as driven by a desire on Beijing's part for data-rich companies to list domestically.

## ANT DECOUPLING

Alibaba also found itself in similar crosshairs when regulators abruptly halted Ant Group's planned $37 billion IPO in Hong Kong in Shanghai in late 2020.

Concurrent with the announcement of its dual primary listing, Alibaba said on Tuesday in its annual financial report that several Ant Group executives had stepped down from their posts in the Alibaba Partnership, a top decision-making body for the e-commerce giant. [**read more**](https://www.reuters.com/business/ant-group-executives-step-down-alibaba-partnership-2022-07-26/)

The departures are part of an ongoing decoupling of the fintech division from Alibaba, spurred by the botched IPO.[ **read more**](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ant-alibaba-plan-less-intertwined-future-after-china-crackdown-2022-06-21/)

Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment advisor United First Partners in Singapore, said that Alibaba's decision would boost Alibaba shares due to its potential inclusion in Stock Connect.

""With regards to other tech listings of similar kind, this will be the playbook for companies looking to hedge against regulatory risk that Chinese companies are facing on the U.S. bourses,"" he said.

In order to switch to a dual primary listing, the HKEX said companies had to have a good track record of at least two full financial years listed overseas, and a capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion ($5.10 billion) or a market value of at least HK$10 billion plus revenue of at least HK$1 billion for the most recent financial year.

wallstreetbet,This is fine.
wallstreetbet,"The Secret to NOT Capitulate EVER**Introduction:** 

Like many of my fellow apes, I initially started trading with a large amount of cash. I was very successful when I did swing trading, did okay at day trading and then I learned about options and my life has been **\[***insert some depressing noun here***\]** ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

This being said, I love trading options and since I have first started I have gotten significantly better. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So, let's dive into today's topic: Trading Options with dividend tendies.** 

Let's say you took $20,000 and invested it into a dividend stock that paid out monthly like QYLD. 

You would get paid $200 a month in dividends every month from that stock. 

What do you do with these dividends you ask, well you use those funds to then trade options. 

Essentially, you invest $20k and use the dividends to learn how to become a successful trader.

&amp;#x200B;

If and when you blow that account up, no worries. You get paid again next month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the idea has been presented, let's be real. $200 / month is enough to trade like 1 0dte spy option and if you suck at managing risk it won't last more than 1 - 3 days. In this, you have two real choices: 

1. Get better at managing risk
2. Invest like $50k so you can have more monies to trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now go and conquer my fellow Apes.**

&amp;#x200B;

BMW (BMW.DE) Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft has started to nickle and dime its most loyal customers. Various features of the car will require a monthly subscription to unlock heated seats, functions of the stereo and extra sports features of the cars. 

So here's my idea. As an investor of apartment REITS I've written a letter to send to my REITs. With more Americans unable to afford to buy homes and now stuck as renters forever. I'm proposing we make toilets a subscription plan. It will be multi tiered. I was thinking 1 flush/use a day $100 a month. 3 Flushes are $300. Our most popular plan, the Unlimited plan allows up to 5 flushes/use per day included and an extra $25 a flush/use after the 5 per flush/use has been consumed. We could have family plans and single user plans. Should users not have the unlimited plan, don't worry we have that worked out. We have an emergency usage fee of $150 a month, that also comes with a $15 processing fee, a $4.20 sewer fee and a $1 waste fee."
wallstreetbet,"A foolproof way of making unlimited tendies with a small sacrificeSo I was just scrolling on r/wsb on a typical Monday evening looking for some dopamine hit and I came across this crazy OCD dude's (he said it himself) post, [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w7zhln/monkeypox\_why\_everyone\_is\_wrong\_and\_i\_am\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w7zhln/monkeypox_why_everyone_is_wrong_and_i_am_right/).

Started feeling very scared and also started thinking about liquidating everything and put it on $SIGA until I saw this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w7zhln/comment/ihncnuq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) by u/drummer820 (he claims he has a PhD and some experience in infectious animal diseases so if u/Hang10Dude (this is the OCD guy) has no problem believing in the Nigerians and I shouldn't have any problem believing in u/drummer820.  

But I like the OCD's guy play $SIGA.  If the Nigerians are wrong and u/drummer820 boy is right, $SIGA wouldn't get anywhere, we don't like that do we?  

I have come up with a simple plan to get unlimited tendies: 

1). load up on $SIGA, shares/calls doesn't matter

2). this is where ""a small sacrifice"" comes in, you need to be gay for a few months (we are just pretending), we will go to gay bars and let us get fucked by gay men.  

3). once we are sure that we have the disease, we will not tell anyone and spread it as much as we can and then pump those ""active cases"" number up

4). once those numbers go to the moon, the various governments around the world would have no choice but to order a lot of treatment from $SIGA hence making the share price goes to PLUTO!

5). profit and then stop pretending to be gay and go back to your normal life.  

6). drink Maitais all day and sleep with instagram models on an greek island."

I can't understand going on strike during some of the most financially difficult times for your company. And the offer by Boeing looks pretty damn good.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There are 2,500 members of the International Association of Machinists set to go on strike at 12:01 am central time on August 1. The plants are in St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, and Mascoutah, Illinois.   


BA lost **billions** and the union says:  


&gt; ‚ÄúThis company continues to make billions of dollars each year off the backs of our hardworking members. Boeing previously took away a pension from our members, and now the company is unwilling to adequately compensate our members‚Äô 401(k) plan.

Boeing negotiated and offered matched dollar-for-dollar up to 10% of worker‚Äôs base and incentive pay towards 401(k) contributions. Boeing also offered to make a special contribution of 2% of workers‚Äô pay in 2023 and 2024, and to ***provide matches on student loan payments for workers‚Äô children***. 

The proposed three-year agreement would have raised average wages by 7.2% in the first year of the contract in addition to giving workers a $1,000 cash bonus, according to a web site about the offer from the company. Workers would have received a 4% increase in the second year and a 3% raise in the third year, according to Boeing.

Props to u/anonymouser3 for the dd.  

$FAZE (previously) $BRPM is a brand new de-spac that brought public FaZe Clan (yes- that FaZe Clain).

The merger was closed and it changed ticker last Wednesday.

Here is the chart since merger, so far clearly playing out as a classic case of a battle between longs and shorts on a micro-float.

https://preview.redd.it/qi6ap3mqxsd91.jpg?width=1396&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deed6e3a9284de2099a6af3ae882bd19bfff11c6

Let me break down the data for you:

8-K filing 2/23/21 (Signifying common stock at IPO (17,250,000):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lpq53c2txsd91.jpg?width=3042&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ea4310057c9faeeb8e8969b23eab27e015013bd

8-K filing 7/22 (Signifying 92% redemptions - 15,883,395 shares) :

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves a public post-merger float of 1,366,605.

https://preview.redd.it/zq2xx58wxsd91.jpg?width=2966&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc40d7f9e4200940e569ff0c033f88b5af78de56

The rest of the shares are locked up and as with any new de-spac, they need an S-1 filing after the merger and then an EFFECT made by the SEC to be sold on the open market. The current rate for this to occur is approx. 2-3 months from merger on average. So the float is locked and there is no dilution until then- this includes warrants.

**Short Interest**

Current Ortex as of 7/25 post-market:

831,080 shares short which means 61% short interest.

https://preview.redd.it/5tdi6qe0ysd91.jpg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c23c16731fc9d7b80943455e4d5021d52e55382e

Current S-3 short interest post-market 7/25:

1,670,000 short meaning 122% short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7cxs4128ysd91.jpg?width=956&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed7062f4a0a98bf1580f27ec951fc70ee0a6337d

S-3 is considered the most reliable short data on the internet but let's play it on the safe side and say it's anywhere in between 61% - 122% short. Possibly the most shorted stock in the entire market right now.

**The Options Chain**

Currently 6,083 contracts are covered by calls up to the $12.5 strike in OI which would be \~45% of the FF. Options chain got absolutely smacked today with calls after the redemption numbers and low float spread online and we are looking to have nearly the entire float ITM through calls at $12.5 and more than likely at $15 tomorrow if most of the call volume translates to OI.

Today's call vol. alone represented more than the entire float in shares up to the $25 strike.

Gamma is building fast.

With a float just about the size that $IRNT's was when it went $8 - $47.5 off a de-spac gamma squeeze, I don't see why this doesn't do something similar as it catches more eyes. Also, this ticker is much more memeable and FaZe Clan has a CULT following that I think is likely FOMO into any kind of squeeze.

Stop betting on horses and buy yourself a horse track.As some of you may know, Tesla isn‚Äôt the only car-maker in the world. You may have even heard of Ford? What about BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Chevrolet, Kia, Cadillac, Hyundai, Lexus, Mazda, Subaru, or Volvo? Come to think of it, I know for a fact some of you out there have heard of Rivian, Nio, and Lucid (you know who you are, I‚Äôve seen your loss porn).

Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ If that doesn‚Äôt tell you things are changing, then just go ahead and stick those crayons right up your ass and ass-blast away at a dart board to make your next stock picks.

At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck which car company wins the EV arms race (and you best believe it‚Äôs an arms race: [https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment](https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment) ). I don‚Äôt even own a single horse in that race. You know why? Because I‚Äôm buying the god-damned horse track.

You know what every single EV needs besides an autist behind the wheel? A BATTERY, YOU FUCKSTICK.

What do you need to make a battery? Lots of stuff actually‚Ä¶ but primarily? LITHIUM.

For those of you with less than a 3rd grade reading level, let me paint a picture for you through a few pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

EV sales are expected to nearly 6X from now to 2030 in just the US alone:

[See how the chart goes up? That means we need more batteries. Just in case, let‚Äôs go over this again. What do batteries need? LITHIUM.](https://preview.redd.it/vvteve6mesd91.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf071f095201fe135688d8e86ce64d8995deb561)

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs a projection of how much lithium we need to meet the EV demand:

[Notice how this chart also goes up? Almost like it‚Äôs related to the first one?](https://preview.redd.it/89nolvxnesd91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1db22399b53255b83322059888c718cff685a7ca)

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs how much lithium we‚Äôve been making globally:

[I know this is going to be a lot to take in, but really focus here. The lithium demand chart up above was showing numbers scaled in 1,000‚Äôs of metric tons, and this one isn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs an easy trick, pretend the numbers on this chart stop after the comma. There you go, you did it!](https://preview.redd.it/ekhh99aresd91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dfb03fa980bc72daf43b7e622eafd9d2f846233)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we‚Äôre on the same page, doesn‚Äôt it seem like we might have just a little bit of an issue here? I realize you probably dropped that community college economics 101 course mid-term after your dad said he was disappointed in you for puking on his basement carpet again while struggling through your 5th hangover that week‚Ä¶ but even you, you scholar, probably took away one iota of understanding from the first topic of that class: supply and demand.

Alas, just in case you were distracting from texting that Sophomore in your local high-school that you wanted to hook-up with while the professor‚Äôs soulless eyes bleakly looked around the nearly empty room, I‚Äôll just go ahead and show you how lithium prices have responded:

[Yeah, line goes brrrrrr. Now it‚Äôs hitting home, right? Lithium prices are up 10X since the start of 2021 and 5X since last summer \(important to note for below\). Side note: this chart is in CNY \(Chinese Yuan\) because China currently dominates the world‚Äôs lithium market, but that‚Äôs a conversation for another time. Long story short, the world doesn't want China controlling global lithium supplies.](https://preview.redd.it/e41lshctesd91.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7684f6c589979e73e450687deac4d71665a9d50)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've had some pictures for you to look at, hopefully that convinced you to buckle up and choke down that third Adderall pill so you can focus for the next five god-damn minutes and read the rest of this so you can pass out and yarf on your own carpet one day. Take that Dad.

There‚Äôs a couple last important things to note with the charts above.

1.)  Producing more lithium can‚Äôt be done with the flip of a switch. Most new facilities take a minimum of 5-7 years to be planned, approved, and start producing. Back in May, some window-licker over at Goldman Sachs wrote that he thinks the lithium market has peaked until 2025 ( [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf) ).

Here‚Äôs what just a few others had to say about that report:

\- [https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/](https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/)

\- [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg)

\- [https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/)

&amp;#x200B;

But I mean Goldman‚Äôs is never wrong, right? They couldn‚Äôt possibly be releasing a report like this to sink the lithium market so they can buy more for less, right?? I mean if they thought the lithium market was going to tank for the next few years because of over-supply, they would never BUY MORE Lithium stocks right???

Yep, you guessed it. Straight from their most recent 13F-HR filing:

[This is their Q1 filing‚Ä¶ I wonder what their Q2 will have to say when released‚Ä¶](https://preview.redd.it/zwpox5ayesd91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3365cae45ac8e4ac20dab84cf2eb781d80de6c5)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, while typically I try not to condone this kind of behavior, I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Window Licker himself to thank him for giving us the buying opportunity of a lifetime on many of these lithium stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

2.)  Lithium producers typically sign contracts to sell their product for a set amount of time (commonly one year) for a set price throughout the contract. So, going back to that handy-dandy lithium spot pricing chart, I want you to take a gander at about when that pretty little line went parabolic (hint: I fucking marked it). For those of you who are too lazy to scroll up or if you‚Äôre just unsure and want to double check your work: August 2nd, 2021. Hmm, that's about a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do with this information? We buy companies that produce lithium of course and we bet an unreasonable amount of our portfolio on it to boot. Now to the part all you shit-flingers will probably skip down to: ‚ÄúJust tell me what to buy already!‚Äù Here‚Äôs a brief summary on my lithium plays and my positions.

   
 

\- Albemarle ($ALB) ‚Äì 50 Shares, two 8/19 $250C, one 8/19 $260C

o Earnings Call: 8/3 After Hours

o One of the world‚Äôs current largest lithium producers than has multiple lithium mines in production and several others projects on the way. They absolutely destroyed their Q1 earnings report and should crush it once again for the next 3-4 quarters at a minimum as profits from those beautiful new lithium contracts from last year start to roll in. They are also diversified (hard word, I know) and are involved in several other market segments, but make no mistake this is still a lithium play at the end of the day. Additionally, they are US based so they‚Äôre going to get some of that sweet sweet low-interest government money courtesy of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM).

\- Lithium Americas ‚Äì 920 Shares, fifteen 8/19 $30C, nine 11/18 $30C

o Earnings Call: 8/4 Pre Market

o Massive upside on this company as probably the most intriguing junior lithium miner right now. Sure, they haven‚Äôt made any profit yet, but that‚Äôs a pretty fucking big ‚Äúyet‚Äù. They are currently in the final stages of approvals for the largest lithium mine in North America at Thacker Pass in Nevada. Once this makes it through a final court case appeal this September it will be all system go on this project and I would bet my left nut that that will be the case here. I won‚Äôt get too far into this since I have written about it before, but there are several other catalysts on the horizon and revenues are coming very very soon. My PT on this one is $150/share by the end of 2025.  Massive upside here, don‚Äôt miss the boat. I‚Äôll likely be turning some of my earnings play profits into many more 11/18 &amp; 2/17 calls.

\- Livent ($LTHM) ‚Äì 300 Shares, two 8/19 $25c, thirty 8/19 $30C, five 8/19 $40C

o Earnings Call: 8/2 After Hours

o Another US based company with projects that are already producing. Major earnings beat in their last call and I fully expect them to blow it out of the water once again and for the next several quarters. They are heavily focused on being as green and sustainable as possible, which is an important factor in this field. I think we could see $40/share by early next year.

\- Sociedad Quimica y Minera ($SQM) ‚Äì 50 Shares (No options‚Ä¶yet)

o Earnings Call: 8/17 After Hours

o More similar to Albemarle since they are well-diversified, but at the end of the day their lithium production is one of their biggest revenue drivers. I‚Äôll probably write an article on them prior to their earnings so, I‚Äôll just say I have option plays to come on this one as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Do you know someone who drives a car? Well odds are, At least one of their next two cars will probably be electric. Electric cars need lithium for their batteries. Buy lithium producers and own your own god-damn horse track. God speed retards, and let that speed be electric."

As a starting point, we will save our money from the Wendy's fo'-fa'-fo' and use that as a basis point for this Formula/DD.

wallstreetbet,"The anti-YOLO strategy: Long Butterfly spreads?I'm sick of DD, and also sick of trying to mind-meld the market to see which way SPY will trade on any given day. But, I did read that there are several strategies where sideways movement will pay out. One is the Long Call Butterfly, where you sell 2x calls at a given strike, and buy two flanking calls. Basically, this strategy pays out if the stock moves within the range of the two flanking calls, with a maximum payout at the center strike price.

My thought is that you can control for the risk of the strategy by looking at the overall standard deviation of stock price movement for a given DTE. For example, if a stock moves with a standard deviation of 5$ in a week over the past year, then it's pretty likely that it will stay within a +- envelope in the next 5 days.

Knowing this, could I do a Long Call Butterfly on an ETF with generally not that much volatility as compared to stocks (like SPY), with 5-7 days DTE? Is there something I am missing? I could also buy a 3DTE spread in the morning, and close it before the end of day, as there would be enough decay to make me some money? If I sell it the same day, it probably won't be a lot of gains but a couple of guaranteed percent per day to me sounds pretty attractive...

I'm seeing the following risks: 
- Early assignment: I could mitigate this by using something like XSP (or SPX). 
- Low volume: I need someone to sell the contracts to in order to close the strategy. XSP has low volume, but is it low enough that I can't even do a market sell? I could also just pick strikes with high OI to maximize the probability of it closing.

Would love to hear more feedback on this strategy or whether anyone has tried this!"

wallstreetbet,"A generally safe place to park your money. Gold, a decent store of value.There's a lot of uncertainty in the world right now, probably the most there's ever been in human history. The population of the world has never been this high, technology has never gone this far and the world has never been this connected. The most uncertain is whether the dollar stays the reserve currency for much longer. 

The case for gold as a store of value for the next 5 years or so until things clear up, settle down or the whole world economy changes forever. 

1. has a long history, has been a currency since the beginning of time. 
2. less volatility, compared to other asset classes. 
3. globally recognized as valuable.
4. central banks around the world are stocking piling gold instead of foreign currency. 
5. has industrial uses. 
6. harder to steal compared to digital assets. 
7. More scarce than people realize as a lot of the gold trading currently is synthetic paper and not actually available for delivery. 

I also wanted to note the 31 million metric tons of **gold ore** discovery in Uganda is unverified. Its gold ore not actually ounces of produced bars. I'm also guessing the samples taken were contaminated to make it look like there is more than there actually is. Like in the movie Gold with  Matthew McConaughey, his partner adds a few flakes of Gold to his sample to make it look like there is a huge deposit of Gold in the mine but there actually isn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm not saying we are going to some global gold standard coin, I'm just saying the dollar wont go up forever and will start being sold off as the US enters a recession and the US becomes a less attractive place to invest compared to the rest of the world."

wallstreetbet,"DD: Nextech AR Solutions CorpFellow regards,

I want to share you my thoughts on this company that is now making a little name for itself, and could be in the very beginning of something huge. I will support my thesis with as much info and links so you can make your own conclusions. 

This company called ''**Nextech AR solutions**'' specializes as one of the *few public traded companies* in this field in augmented reality, holograms and creating 3D models used for e-commerce. This company is young: Founded in 2018 by Evan Gappelberg and is surrounded by a team of experienced software developers, this company already landed **AMAZON** as one of their customers.

See link: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220712005281/en/Nextech-AR-Becomes-3D-Model-Supplier-For-Prime-Marketplace-And-Signs-Multiple-New-3D-Contracts](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220712005281/en/Nextech-AR-Becomes-3D-Model-Supplier-For-Prime-Marketplace-And-Signs-Multiple-New-3D-Contracts)

[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-07-12/nextech-ar-becomes-3d-model-supplier-for-prime-marketplace-and-signs-multiple-new-3d-contracts](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-07-12/nextech-ar-becomes-3d-model-supplier-for-prime-marketplace-and-signs-multiple-new-3d-contracts)

Furthermore they are designing models for the **Shopify** app, where customers can create, and customize the potential goods they want to buy. 

This video posted on august 11 goes about the CEO talking about the fact that the company has already landed another batch of multiple contracts

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWajw8hBzTY&amp;ab\_channel=Proactive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWajw8hBzTY&amp;ab_channel=Proactive)

As of know this stock trades at 0.78 CAD on the Frankfurt stock Exchange, and has gotten a price target of $ 2.50. 

Growth:

wallstreetbet,"What do you think about the impact of retail investors on stock markets ?Hello everyone,
I don't really know if this is the place to have such discussion, so tell me if my post doesn't belong here.
I've read some papers as I'm doing my master thesis and it seems that retail investors for example have a positive effect on the liquidity of stocks and so lower cash risks. They can also be the cause of sudden surge in volatility of stock prices (the gamestop case is one of the biggest example).
I just wanted to discuss this to have your opinions on the other effects (positive or negative) that we can have on stock markets.
Thank you ! Every answer is welcome, I'm trying to learn more and discuss the subject. And of course I know the answers will probably be biased as we are on a dedicated subreddit"

Everyone keeps saying ""oh this is gonna be just like March 2021! Look! This fucking towel company has the same technical set up as the used game company!""

WRONG! *Dumbass*.

March 2021 was the hype peak of the biggest bull run in 20 years you fucking morons...

We had zero percent interest rates, the pandemic was ending, the economy was hot AF and JPOW was promising to run the printers red hot - assuring us there would never be any consequences for ""near infinite liquidity"".

Literally ANY news headline of interest - good or not - was driving stocks up 5-10% on open.

... Meeting earnings expectations was bullish. Missing earnings - but not by too much was bullish.

... Avoiding bankruptcy was bullish. Declaring bankrupcty was bullish.

... Hiring a CEO was bullish. Firing your CEO was bullish.

... Taking out new debt was bullish. Paying off debt was bullish.

... Closing a stock sale and diluting shareholders was bullish. Promising not to sell stocks was bullish.

... Stock splits were bullish. Reverse stock splits were bullish.

... If a stock price was going up - it was bullish. If a stock was taking a little dip - That's right - THAT WAS BULLISH.

... And if anyone suggested anything other than UP, it was already priced in!

2020-2021 was absolute fucking bull semen guzzling euphoria and it's not happening again this decade you fucking idiots.

Stop wasting your money. Stop trying to find the next short squeeze.

**This IS financial advice:**

**Shut the fuck up and play safe until the Fed changes course.**"

wallstreetbet,Down from ATH September 3 Update
wallstreetbet,"Found on LSE Forum regarding Cineworld# Summary of reasons behind Cine recovering back up from rock bottom A number of reasons to be honest, not just one, reading all the comments:

1-Oversold at sub 10p i.efrom 2p

2-Jhango the seller from 9p has exited The key seller has gone.

3-Speculation current ongoing talks regarding Re-structure possibly progressing well in the background. No bankruptcy of company, but looking at ALL OPTIONS. Incl potential sale of Eastern europe business? De-leveraging. As per RNS

4-Suspension talk for days was fallacious comments by certain individuals with an agenda.. People have seen through the scaremongering. Dismissed.

5-Mooky and Family owners are defiant and clearly not going anywhere and NOT selling family 20% holdings. No selling means they are not bailing like some had suggested. RNS

6-Revenues expected to pick up from Nov Cinema business IS expected to pick again. (Cine Plex business already reported their revenues up 400% from 2021 results in Aug-22).

7-Lower risk from 2p-4p. Greater upside potential from 4p

8-Shorts all but 2.7% left only. Stock Buy-backs.

9-Market as a whole ‚Äúover-reacted‚Äùref WSJ article. 9p to 2p. Sp should never have dropped below 10p

11-Investors mopping up Cheap shares and potential to average their holdings, albeit with some risk attached.

12-Cine- Appeal Court date Sept22nd. A favourable outcome maybe worked out. Ref: Feb FT article: Potential for outside settlement on both sides) lower award amount or receive zero. Compromise maybe the key to receive and both parties can agree? Legal teams have to work together for benefit of both companies and sector industry survival.

13-New Cine investors come on-board, who have previously never held Cine, now hold Cine.

14-SP reacting to rises on both markets UK and the US.

15-Interims reporting - SEPT 22nd - good news?

As we progress into next week, more news will add to rise....

As it stands the we are c. 4.5p-5p

10-14p (maybe back) for LTH‚Äôs namely as main sellers JHANGO has dispersed!!"

I‚Äôve been on the sidelines minus my paper hands in $GME and can‚Äôt help but think that we have all been duped into the falsehood that we can actually make a ton of money quickly. Granted, some have won big and I think that‚Äôs great. I do however think that the stock market is a pyramid scheme and this sub is prime real estate for insiders consolidating an even greater percentage of wealth. It‚Äôs a casino, sure but I can assure you, the stock market is rigged for the small club laughing at us from their ivory tower. GME did nothing to actually affect any prominent hedge funds (Melvin is small-time compared to BlackRock).

Now, WHO says the the number of cases worldwide has decrease and the FDA has yet to approve the TPoxx. 

Currently the number of cases are increasing in the U.S and is are now at 50,000 and The Biden administration wants to invest $4.5 Billions dollars to fight the virus from spreading. I think Canada wants more supplies of the vaccination although the case are low. 

So, at this point i'm asking myself if  I should wait for the approval of the FDA or should I sell at a lost? I do believe that the antidote will be approve, because of the growing number of people being affected on a daily basis and there are not enough of the vaccination to keep up with the demand. 

Right now the price seats at $14.55 aftermarket hours. So, it it will need a catalyst to see the stock go in an uptrend movement. If we do get another positive rally I'm exiting at $26 or $27. I don't know if the stock can reach higher and yes, it would be great if it did, but I think that the max it could go is $29.

I guess the question is clear, I also underestand that market conditions and how does it go down make a difference, but on average, if it foes down 2 points a day 398, 396, 394, 390 I guess that the daily put should be more profitable in acumulation as the daily expiration make the buying put cheaper because of time decay, right?

Also, maybe for the second scenario of the put for Friday for simplicity, and again I underestand that market conditions can affect, but as a general rule, what would be the best target price if I'm on a Monday at 400, sure that it will be 390 by Friday, and when should it be sold?"

I watch as the baggage handlers load everything on my flight ""man that would suck"" I scoff to myself as I begin reading the emergency situation pamphlet in front of me. ""Wow, pretty scary but this shit would never happen to me"". 

We take off, I watch as the ground slips away and feel euphoric as we sail through the clouds, ""to the moon!"" I exclaim with joy. We reach cruising altitude, but it doesn't feel high enough; no way this is the top! 

My stomach drops at the same time as the plane. ""What? I thought this flight was longer"" Shortly I find how wrong I was as the landing gear deploys and we make a rough landing on the tarmac. ""Excuse me miss"" I spurt out to the flight attendant ""Wasn't this the flight to Tendie Town?"" She shakes her head and laughs at me as she grabs my uneaten bag of peanuts off my armrest. 

I'm in shock, I don't believe it and I won't believe it. I get off the plane and go to the only place that's left....

I was pretty sure NVDA was going to drop a bit more than it did, and while trying to figure out why, I found out that Cathie doubled down on her NVDA investment and bought in yesterday.  That caused a brief bit of a turn around.  I'm pretty sure that was a bad move on her part.  Or at least she bought in too early and should have let it fall to about $128 first.  The stock seems to be over bought for the time being and I would guess it will still fall to about $128 next week.

wallstreetbet,"PSNY, meme stock potential?PSNY got absolutely fucked this week.  It went from like 9 dollars to 6.75 a share, absolute blood bath.

That being said, PSNY is not a fail company like Bed Bath and Beyond.  They actually make sexy electric care and have been meeting all of their production goals.
Additionally they scored a deal with Hertz for 50 thousand of their Polestar 2s.

This is my theory and you can dismiss it as retarded as you want but I think one of the reasons  they got mogged is because a lot of their production is still in China which is getting bent over backwards by lock downs and climate change disasters.

Fortunately though, Polestar is moving production to the USA and their upcoming Polestar 3 will be manufactured exclusively in South Carolina.
Their big reveal and pre orders of the Polestar 3 begin in October and being that it is an SUV I suspect it will sell very well.

I think Tuesday may be an excellent time to buy the dip."

wallstreetbet,"9-2-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly Recap and Market AnalysisWhat a way to end the week. This morning was probably one of the most bullish technical days with volume, vix, momentum, etc. etc. that I have seen in weeks and we still managed to close spy &gt;1% red. 

https://preview.redd.it/19ksttiwfjl91.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca3491efe1c3bf118cf892d5e0d6639d7c1ee788

If you had taken my call out you woulda reaped the rewards had you sold immediately at open. However, despite the pretty amazingly bullish morning we had (after the $3 sell off) we put in a big resistance today and from there it was an elevator to the bottom. 

https://preview.redd.it/b314vjnxfjl91.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f25a1cff8012d85f03b285aba7cd80ef520786

Todays and yesterdays intraday charts are pretty much polar opposites of each other. 

https://preview.redd.it/845zva8yfjl91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d8cc35aafc174bee33ea39e3e341f90d9fee79f

There is a lot of bearish about this chart, however, there is also a lot of bullish about it too. 

Lets talk about the bullishness of this week and this chart. 

Spy just had a 13 day sell off for a nice $41.69 drop or 10.7%. 

Lets reference back to last weeks weekly TA for a second here‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/x39oaasyfjl91.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0eaba5c66d5ca54713f88dd4b9cfba318ba4c46

So we are 2 days and 2.6% (379.9 potential low) from the average drop from highs during this bear market. That then brings up the question of are we at the end of this sell off or is there more to go? 

Yesterdays sell off was the result of 390/391 support holding up stoutly and providing a massive bounce. That 391 level is a key support level on the daily that spy has established in 2022. With yesterdays bounce off 390 and then todays bounce off 390 I actually am suspecting a small bounce next week. With the failure two days in a row to break through 390 that is showing that it is going to take a bit more to break through this level. As I have mentioned before we are at a spot where we can play spy level to level. This 391 level refusing to break actually infers we should make a run back for 405.2 next. 

Today intraday there was a lot to be said that we might actually see a run back to 405.2 today or Tuesday (no trading Monday), however, 401.4 put in extreme tough resistance and due to some news about oil supply (as far as I can tell‚Ä¶ see tweet below) markets went in to a massive 3.5 hour $11.23 nose dive. 

https://preview.redd.it/4mb1jxezfjl91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15e4cb4f66422c2e2810710213bd0fbfeae577f9

However, despite that massive sell off there was still a failure to break through 390 EOD and even a bigger pop EOD. 

https://preview.redd.it/sctb6q20gjl91.png?width=815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07c565d662d1465c308f21fe7097b7d4da680275

Looking at SPY weekly you can see that we bounced right off key 390 weekly support. Holding that will provide some upside and until we break and close below that 390 level there is more upside to be expected. 

The current resistance line from this sell off sits at 395.9 for next week and support will be at 390. From 390 we have the recovery support line at 388.9. If we see 388.9 fail next week that would be a bigger signal of a sell off possibly back to the lows in the 360s. 

If you see that purple line that utilizes the March high and June low to project a possible sell off if we see the same sort of sell off. This gives us a bear trajectory of 332 by October 31st if we were to see the same sell off as March to June. 

Overall looking at this chart and knowing that CPI is on September 13th (Tuesday) and that usually the markets start to price in CPI about 3 days before. If we are under the same sort of scenario I would for see a small move up to 405.2 early next week and we end the week on Friday with a bigger sell off. This would then lead into a sell off into the week of CPI. If we were to see a bad CPI (as of now there is still no prediction or forescast) that could accelerate a sell off down to 360s before FOMC, however, a good CPI would start a rally in my opinion back over 430 and possibly 460 eventually. 

I am bullish (short term) until a daily candle closes below 390. I am bearish once a daily candle closes below 390 and will remain that way till we see a change in sentiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/u7gmvrs0gjl91.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8ffb607841293f708f884465da63f85cffe75cf

Futures is showing a lot of the same sentiment. Bullish until 3900 breaks and bearish once that does break. 

Support is 3900 -&gt; 3827 -&gt; 3675

Resistance is 4000 -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4060

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa4g24g2gjl91.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5709730263312932898bfda4752d8839c081cac

Apple had an interesting day today too. 

Along with SPY they both perfectly rejected their daily 8 emas. However, Apple attempted for the 2nd day in a row to break below and attempted to close below the daily 200ema, however, was once again unable to. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37ou7833gjl91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7955134ddf94f32068b3de97d8fd5e52c66f5436

Apple is also another great candidate for level to level, however, unfortunately we ended in the middle of a level. We held 154.2 this week which is the daily 50ema. That should provide an upside push to retest resistance at 157.6 and eventually 161 which is this sell offs downward resistance line. 

Key support will be at 154.2 which would ensure a break down of apples 13 week bull support and would signal a bigger move down of Apple into the 140s.

I have the same purple trajectory line on Apple which shows a possible downside of 125 by October 31st is the same level of intensity and sell off was to occur of March to June. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mu3h6l3gjl91.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893a53038a33bb03c3168f2c7026fa0ea0ea8686

The VIX had a really interesting day actually. It started off the day with a massive sell off (when we were hella bullish) that led to a massive spike of the VIX to a peak of 26.3. However, the Vix managed to close its daily candle back under 25.5. 

I have 18.9 to 25.5 and 25.5 to 34.9 as a key level for the VIX. We spent a lot of time in that 25.5 to 34.9 level which is when we spent most of our time selling off. However, the fact that the VIX is not ready to hold over 25.5 and is not ready to see a higher move up to 30 despite a 13day and 10%+ sell off says a lot. This also gives me a bigger expectation of a move to the upside. 

My expectations would be a move Tuesday thru Thursday up to that 405.2 range and then Friday will start the next sell off. 

Remember markets need a reason to sell off. CPI will be the next catalyst for a sell off followed by FOMC.

10% challenge-

This was a frustrating week for me where I just beat myself. I started the week off with a big loss (my own fault for removing my stop loss and thinking a bigger sell off was coming‚Ä¶ of course came the next day). I fought back all week trying to get back to a green. I managed to recover a lot of my loss but still finished red. 

I miss played yesterday failing to take profits on two winning puts that the EOD massive rally burnt me on. Then I unfortunately got caught bag holding a call right before the markets bottom fell out. I was able to turn the day around today and finish nicely green though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yavjc654gjl91.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3cdb0bd366879f0f8c3206733b66e88a9cde6f1

The good from this week was my swings. This week I played some 5-7dte swings on apple and spy that all paid well. I went extremely small so despite how well they paid. I also did really good this week identifying level to level and setups. However, I failed to be aggressive enough to capitalize on the moves. I watched a lot of great setups and moves go 20-50% and failed to take them out of caution. 

The biggest failures this week was trusting the trend too much. Monday I expected the trend to continue and it did not. By time I went to cut my loss it was nothing left to cut. Similar happen today that I failed to accept the break down and was expecting a rally (in this market despite the wildness of some of these moves up or down once they happen we really should not expect an equal or bigger reversal). 

I did have two great wins yesterday I failed to take profits on which led to some green and resulted in the week finishing green. Even with my big loss Monday‚Ä¶ had I close my two trades profitable yesterday (when they were green) and today cut my loss any time before I did I actually would have turned in a great week. 

I also let the fact that I was down $xxx all week effect my trades as I was constantly looking for the ‚Äúbig move‚Äù to get me back to green all at once instead of just taking the good clean setups. 

The plan next week is some smaller position sizes with 20% take profits and 30% trailing stop loss on all plays. I am going to be more pro-active and more aggressive with my entries and exits. And when I recognize the move I envisioned didn‚Äôt happen I am going to aggressively exit early instead of letting it run to my stop loss. The full stop loss should only be utilized when I catch a bad move or some sort of fuckery like this mornings dump. 

Everyday is a new day and everyday is a day to learn and improve. Not the week I wanted but I take the good and the bad of every week to revise what I am doing to make the next week that much better. 

I hope you guys have a great weekend and enjoy the extra long weekend.

All trades in my opinion need to be short term in duration .

If the announcement this week is the spinoff of buy buy baby that is great, I will react with some calls to turn a quick profit, but that will be the death nail for the company as that is the most profitable thing they own. In my opinion that will buy the company 6-8 months at best to pull their heads out of their asses. before anyone comments that I am a shill or bot know this, I got into bbby on the 15th and rode to 28 then I rode it back down to about 18 before buying puts. I held until I recognized the writing on the wall, I want this thing to moon but I don‚Äôt realistically see it happening."
wallstreetbet,"Tomorrow RC will announce he will buy BBBYTomorrow RC will announce that he will buy BBBY. On 11/22/2021 he posted a picture of ""Sex for Dummies"". Meaning he had sex there and didn't know how to protect himself. Then on 04/04/22 he posted a picture of a 20 week old baby (BBBY). On average a woman is pregnant for 40 weeks (9 months). 20 weeks from 04/04/2022 is Monday 22 August 2022. 9 months from 11/22/2021 is also The 22nd of August. TOMORROW THE BABY (BBBY) COMES into the world and RC will make the announcement.

It doesn‚Äôt matter, if you are the 800lb gorilla or the tiniest spider monkey with a Robinhood account, it‚Äôs a badge of honor to have an APE symbol showing on top of your portfolio.

The concept of $APE is surreal. Yeah, sure it will get traded as a stock at first. But is it really a stock ? It is a freaking religion being born, and there is a million ape army out there to protect it and to support it. The name will push this thing in its own APE direction. It could become an APE standard of trade and measurement. Real OG apes will demand their physical shares delivered. Every other ape will perhaps want a certificate of APE numerated, printed, and displayed with their academic ape diplomas on the wall. I also predict that there will come around a really smart satoshi ape who will put this APE thing on a blockchain. This will create a new form of tradable APE security amongst apes. In a distant future, apes will be able to buy bananas and coffee with their APE saving accounts. Because of its physical and digital APE strength it will become a currency and wealth standard for apes. Let the ape future begin.

wallstreetbet,"RC to billionare jail or bbby preparing for take off? Fuck do I know**tldr: RC goes to billionare jail or has a plan to buy baby.** Not financial advise.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I see it. People started to buy bbby since:

1. It was the most shorted stock
2. RC owned  around 10% of their stock.
3. Reg sho further added fuel to the hype

**This drove hype that RC has a sweet plan to enhance value and fuck the shorts.**

What has happened since tuesday when we hit high 20s?

1. Shorts have doubled down
2. RC sold his shares
3. Still on reg sho

So basically the thing that has changed is that RC sold his stake aka his sweet plan to fuck the shorts is dead. **Or is it tho?**

What could then possible reasons for RC to sell his shares be?

1. **He knows they will declare bankrupcy.** If this was the case RC will end up in jail for a long time and the gay bears will bath the tears of a million bagholders. I personally do not belive RC would want to go to billionare jail.
2. **They will restructure the company in a shitty way that RC dislikes so he sells his stake before the shitty news hits the market.** If this is the case RC will also end up in billionare jail, Gay bears and cramer will also celebrate.
3. **They will sell buy buy baby to a third party for a tiny amount of money, RC thinks it's way to little and sells his stake before the new hits the market.** Same thing here RC ends up in billionare jail for selling on insider information and bagholders will be bagholding
4. **RC wants to buy baby and in order not to get law suits filed against him (like elon did with conflicts of interest in the solarCity deal), and also possibly not breaking the contract between RC ventures and bbby he exits his position before.** This to me at least is the only explaination that doesnt result in RC ending up in billionare jail. RC will get baby, either incoporated in gme or as its own entity. Perhaps even entitling current bbby shareholders to a tiny percentage of the baby shares. tldr: RC stays out of jail and and shorts r fuk.

So going in the next week this is where we are at:

1. Still the most shorted stock
2. Reg sho
3. **A**. RC will go to billionare jail **or B.** he has a plan to purchase baby, either through RC ventures or incorporate it into GME.

If they spinn baby off  and listing it as a new publicly traded company (maybe sell 95% and giving 5% of the shares to current share holders or something) or selling all of it for a nice cash infusion shit will exit earths atmosphere again since the bear thesis is dead.

Place your bets accordingly or sit this one out. Not financial advise, I know shit about insider trading laws.

Do companies make a planned public announcement where they announce bankruptcy? Don't they just silently file for bankruptcy and let people know it from the news?

Also, there is the recent 8k filing...

I see 3 possible outcomes:

1 - They announce bankruptcy. In this case I announce bankruptcy as well after ordering a rope from Amazon.

2 - They announce some neutral bullshit blahblah. This means that they are not going bankrupt right now, but somewhere in the near future, so we are fucked.

3 - They announce spinoff of Buybuy Baby. This means rockets and watermelon fucking.

wallstreetbet,"THANK YOU!! The real Power of wallstreetbets . $BBBY**I would like to say a few words.**

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to bring up the fact that wallstreet bets are constantly being called market manipulators by the media and that we have pumped the shares to unbelievable heights several times. First they label us as manipulators, but then they tell us to sell our shares, that we have no power or power and that we are just dumb money.

&amp;#x200B;

We had this event where RC sold his shares to $BBBY and media along with all the bitches like SEC. Hedgies , used their power and immediately without any information called it a classic sale and take the profit and adios amigos. Without any research, without any information, they just took the headline and dropped the stock prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I believe in RC and in his cleverness and his steps, since I have also been in GME for over a year and a half. Of course, even though I am down 80% of my position on $BBBY, I remain calm and will buy more this week because I know that this is all just a fabricated bullshit situation from the media and hedgies.

&amp;#x200B;

To get back to the point of this post. Once again we witness the strength of our group. Not for the reason that we manipulated shares, because we don't do that, but for the reason that immediately after they manipulated the price and the media, it showed us again and a huge amount of FUD started to spread everywhere, so a group of retail investors sat down at the table and did another great research.

&amp;#x200B;

The strength of wallstreetbets is that since Friday, several incredible DDs have appeared here again, which are supported by facts and no nonsense and media reports that even hedgies have to puzzle over what all of us can really do.

I would like to thank everyone who is involved in sharing information and hard work here. Don't forget to BUY and HODL. Have a nice rest of the weekend

Learns BBBY stands for ""Bath Bed and Beyond YOLO"" or something

Notices other Redditors in this BBBY and greets them with gentle ape noises (some not Redditors)

wallstreetbet,"Did Ryan Cohen commit crime or the SEC lagged or is this shit completely legal?Yes this week has been crazy as fuck and I made 8k with BBBY but Ryan Cohen made millions with a shady tactic OR legally delaying his filings?

Even though I can't change the past and the damage is done, can someone who has legal knowledge explain to me why did RC's Form 144 went public after he sold everything?

Let me recap the events for you :

On Wednesday 17th around 3:45pm just before market close the SEC released RC's form 144 which states that he had the intention/ability to sell all his positions and this form was signed on Tuesday the 16 by himself.

As you all know this was the first big drop which sent BBBY down to $20 or so. But when the form 144 came out RC had ALREADY sold everything. On the 16 and the 17 his position was liquidated by JP Morgan.

Shady as fuck? Hell yeah, he sold everything before the market even heard about his intention to sell.

On Thursday the 18th after the market was closed there is the filing that confirms that he sold everything so I'm not making everything up.

I'm won't do anything you regards don't worry but I just want to know if one smart brain here in the sub knows if you can delay filings with the SEC or if the SEC has like 24 hours or any delay they want to make a filing go public.

TL;DR : Obligatory congrats and fuck you to RC, he bailed out before anybody knew about his intention to sell (legal or crime)???"

Last week I gambled with my heart. Next week I'll gamble with my balls and brains. This is not financial advice, but...

Something tells me that some of the strategies of the last few weeks might just pan out soon. With soon being a relative term, I'm thinking the next 3 to 21 days. 

Now I'm not going to post charts and graphs of The Iron Cross or The Mexican Cartwheel or whatever gambit from a year or two ago looks like it does today, and we're all going to whatever celestial body.  But in doing my own DD I think there might be a modest play to be had. 

I got fucked Friday afternoon from same day $10.50 puts...that put me OTM an hour before close. But after hours, I was past break even and ITM. Now I'm not saying it's gonna happen, but I fully expect opening bell is gonna bring the price down to between $4-5 ish, (based on some information we now know about vendors, etc).  It would definitely be a good bargain. 

If that's the case, then current Morningstar valuation has it around $13-14. If you've got long calls, great. If you go long with shares, it's a modest profit.

Derivative trading like option and future contract don't affect the price of the underlying assets. What you reallly gain is from the people with opposite position. So it's nothing wrong with apes who buying put option of BBBY as long as they are holding the stock to hedge 
their position. What really drive the stock down is the hedge fund who short the stock. 
My advice is don't fomo guys. Buy the stock when it's dip, not when it's rise. Buy put option when you feel like it's will dip more and call option when it's rising as long as it's within your financial management. And don't panic sell either, selling when you see fit, not when the bag is heavy because you will lock on you lost."

wallstreetbet,"Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial at best and UTTERLY RETARDED at worst.A lot of people don‚Äôt understand how valuations work still. The real reason BBBY is worth nothing is not because of it servicing debt. It pays a measly 70m a year to service that debt. It‚Äôs because its operating margins are garbage + revenue is shrinking (sign of imminent death). A business can lose money, shrink in size, and still be worth something, but once you issue debt, you are no longer in charge of deciding whether to burn your business and asset value down at your own pleasure. Creditors can and will sue to make sure you stop burning cash so they can liquidate the company‚Äôs assets ‚ÄúAT THEIR DISCRETION‚Äù. Even if they magically get a 1x sales valuation on BABY, all that would do is remove their debt, and it would be IMPOSSIBLE to get any more loans after that. Meaning the literal first quarter they have negative enterprise value the company is officially worthless.

That‚Äôs assuming they get the 1x sales for BABY. CHWY, a fresher and more obviously eCoMmErCe face, has a valuation of 2x sales. And that‚Äôs with continued growth potential, HIGH HIGH chance of cost optimization once they reach peak growth, and much more niche retail area. Now compare to BABY which is literally 2 decades old. Probably showing minimal growth. And most importantly, the name is going to be negatively perceived by the market 1) because they‚Äôre associated with a dying name 2) associated with the HF/big money fucker RC (most big equity names and PE bros hate him for the GME debacle) 3) attached to a highly leveraged owner who they can under bid. Might be hard getting more than 0.5-75x sales for that‚Ä¶

Regardless, GME DOESNT have the money, and if they barely did, it would cause THEIR value and ALSO RCS SHARES to decline in value heavily (beyond an initial ape pump which he can not sell). And RC would never put in a billy of his own money, and why would he, IF he also sold out of bbby. Hence gaining no extra value on saving the parent org.

You can‚Äôt just say that IF he did want to buy, he‚Äôd maybe have to liquidate. There has to be good reason for him to want and afford BABY. The entire value of selling BABY isn‚Äôt because he likes it, it‚Äôs because he also pumped an eCommerce asset, CHWY, and the goal would be to utilize stupid valuations to SQUEEZE BBBY. WHICH HE NO LONGER FUCKING OWNS.

The argument is circumstantial AT BEST. Hope this was helpful.

TLDR: BABY at best is worth a billion, which would cover sure BBBY‚Äôs debt. But the company is still worthless and is very close to being force liquidated by its creditors. One billy is more than what GME could afford and what RC would personally buy into, given he‚Äôd lose a ton of value on his existing and equity and would gain nothing on the SHARES HE ALREADY FUCKING SOLD AAAAAAAAA."

A big chunk of money from the state‚Äôs richest man could not buy much Republican primary love for conservative businessman Ken Griffin‚Äôs slate of candidates in Tuesday‚Äôs election for Illinois governor and other statewide offices.

Days after announcing his family and business would leave the state for Florida, Griffin reaped a weak return on his $50 million investment in the formerly obscure mayor of Aurora, Richard Irvin.

Instead, the winner in the proxy battle of right-wing billionaires was Dick Uihlein, the Lake Forest packaging magnate who was the primary source of funds for the successful campaign of state Sen. Darren Bailey in the GOP race for governor.

After spending nearly $54 million to defeat an income-tax hike on the richest people in the state in 2020, Griffin promised he would do as much as he could to prevent that proposal‚Äôs chief backer, the first-term Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, from winning four more years in 2022.

And Griffin put his money where his mouth was, bankrolling the Irvin campaign almost single-handedly.

‚ÄúExcept for wealthy politicians who bankroll their own campaign, this is the largest amount ever given by a single donor to a U.S. candidate at any level,‚Äù according to a report from the Center for Media and Democracy, a progressive watchdog group based in Madison, Wis.

But Griffin‚Äôs efforts to influence the governor‚Äôs race faced major competition from not only Uihlein but also Pritzker ‚Äî who spent heavily from his own personal fortune to ensure he would face Bailey, instead of Irvin, in the November general election.

Pritzker and the Democratic Governors Association spent tens of millions of dollars in the GOP primary, according to Republican and Democratic sources.

In a statement after Irvin conceded the race Tuesday evening, Griffin did not mention Uihlein or Bailey, blaming Irvin‚Äôs defeat entirely on Pritzker and the Democrats.

‚ÄúI believe Richard Irvin would have been a terrific Governor, and I am proud to have supported his campaign,‚Äù Griffin said. ‚ÄúThe unprecedented tens of millions of dollars spent by Pritzker and national Democrats in the Republican Primary to avoid facing Richard in the General Election demonstrated he was the right candidate.‚Äù

Griffin also took this parting shot at the governor: ‚ÄúThe people of Illinois deserve so much better than four more years of the out-of-control crime, high taxes, and continued corruption that have defined J.B. Pritzker‚Äôs time in office.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear if Griffin will continue his heavy spending in Illinois politics after he and his Citadel hedge fund have packed up and left for Miami. But what was obvious was that his latest big bet on elections in this state was a big failure, up and down the ballot.

The Griffin-supported candidate for secretary of state, John Milhiser, and his pick for attorney general, Steve Kim, also lost Tuesday.

The $50 million from Griffin accounted for nearly 95% of what Irvin took into his campaign account, records show.

Griffin also gave $6,000 each to other candidates he endorsed in statewide races: Milhiser, Kim, Shannon Teresi (running unopposed for the GOP nomination for comptroller) and Tom Demmer (unopposed for the Republican nod for state treasurer).

But Irvin funneled some of the huge amounts he got from Griffin to the down-ballot candidates on the slate. Records show Irvin passed on more than $700,000 to Milhiser, more than $500,000 to Kim and $50,000 to Teresi.

Uihlein spent far less than Griffin in this election cycle. He gave $9 million to Bailey and more than $8 million to the People Who Play By The Rules PAC, which ran ads against Irvin.

The contributions from Uihlein represented nearly 77% of all the money raised in the campaign by Bailey, a farmer from the small town of Louisville, Ill., which is about 240 miles south of Chicago.

Griffin and Uihlein also clashed in the 15th Illinois Congressional District‚Äôs Republican primary between two incumbent U.S. representatives, Mary Miller and Rodney Davis. Miller defeated Davis on Tuesday.

While Griffin gave $1.5 million to a group opposing Miller ‚Äî who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump ‚Äî Uihlein gave $3 million to a political fund that helped Miller and attacked Davis, according to federal campaign-disclosure reports.

In state and local races alone, Griffin has contributed a total of about $179 million in Illinois in the past couple decades, including:

$53.7 million to defeat the graduated income tax amendment two years ago.
$36 million to Bruce Rauner‚Äôs winning bid for governor in 2014 and his losing re-election bid four years later.
$10.75 million to give the Illinois Supreme Court a more conservative bent.
And Illinois is not the only place where Griffin has spent heavily in this year‚Äôs elections.

He has ‚Äúbecome the largest GOP mega-donor in the country for combined federal and state campaigns this election cycle,‚Äù according to Center for Media and Democracy researcher Don Wiener.

Even as he spent more in Illinois than in any other state this year, Griffin also contributed roughly $42 million to Republican candidates at the federal level ‚Äî more than anybody in U.S. politics except Democrat supporter George Soros, Wiener found."

wallstreetbet,"When it all comes tumbling down... 

Can we just take a moment to acknowledge general fundamentals of business theory. We know that business isn't an exact science, and if anything is more of a social science, which leads me to make a couple of key points about what is going on here. For over a century now, different business leader and common folk, alike, have been touting their systems for getting rich quick. (ie the best system for trading, ""get in on this stock because the charts say,"" etc.)

By now, we have enough periodical evidence to show the contrary. There is no best system and for the most part it is a crapshoot. However, there are some key principles that have allowed those like Warren Buffett to come out on top. They are fundamentalists, but not on the micro-level, as much as they move liquidly between the macro and micro levels of the world's economics to gain a perspective that appears to be nothing more than magic. But is it?

NO! It is not magic, it is a sense that has been trained on basic principles of economics that have been around since the beginning of the Medici and Adam Smith. Even further back, truthfully, to the time of the barter system. These principles, in my own opinion and sense relate mostly to what we see as the Carrying Capacity in Biology of a species, or community in a particular, and relatively closed, environment/system. In this theory, there are many contributing factors, much as there are in the stock markets, but given enough time a healthy trend line that points to an elastic tightening around said line. Again, all based on the principles of Supply &amp; Demand. Armed with this knowledge, and historical data to show that the trends are there and that a Bull market, much like the (now) previous one, there must a relatively proportionate contraction that will fall somewhere within the line of a slightly less than equal, but opposite, trend in the other direction, to then be followed by another correction upwards, so on and so forth until meeting, eventually with that averaging line of carrying capacity.

We know this is not permanent due to changes in markets and that is why we see what many call the ""cyclical"" changes or seasons of the markets we experience regularly. My question is this: armed with this knowledge, how can any of you b\*\*\*\*\*\* even remotely think there will be a huge comeback rally that will last?

wallstreetbet,"The Autists guide to Inflation**Listen Up,**

before you pop your morning dose of Adderall and give your wife's boyfriend a foot massage, let me clue you in on something really important.  The masters of the Economy (And hence the master of the remains of your tech portfolio) are shit scared of inflation. **Jerome Powell, The Fed, Charlie Munger, Biden**, Wallmart, Wallstreet and everybody else is shit-scared of inflation. **Your mother is scared of inflation** (How will she pay for your Wetabix and XBox games tomorrow?).

What is inflation though? Common knowledge is, that **it is the increase of price levels by a surplus of money or a shortage of things**. Too much money, chasing too few things = stuff gets more expensive, too little money, too many things: stuff get cheaper.

So far so easy, there is however a psychological component to it. Companies adjust prices and production preemptively based on their future expectations. In order to protect their inventory and shield themselves from compressed margins they might produce way more than forecasted or adjust forward pricing based on their expectations on their rising cost and higher sales prices. . Producers might start hoarding parts as they might be more difficult to obtain down the road. The great chip shortage appears to be greatly intensified due to the fact that everyone and their mother order way more than than they need just to ensure the other guy is not snatching their inventory.

This is a really hard problem to tackle in times of super intricate global supply chains that try to get everything just in time because warehouses and inventory are surprisingly expensive. (This is also why Amazon will rather burn your returns than deal with them with any degree of intimacy). So as a business owner you have to predict the demand for your stuff, the availability of the stuff you need, the prices of the stuff you need etc. **SUPER HARD**. Remember, everybody has to do it for themselves and the guess what the others are doing. So like when people are rushing into a stock, you have these self-reinforcing systems. (George Soros calls this ""Reflexivity""). This worked surprisingly well for the last 30 years. There is only one issue, the whole organism of global trade is much more fragile than anyone expected. So when this happened:

&amp;#x200B;

[The shitshow that was the last two years](https://preview.redd.it/548iovzlfq891.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fc962dc0e58710f5f1e1445b70e537cb509376e)

The models did not really capture the dynamic nature of reality completely. The infinite money glitch from the fed was just the icing on the cake. So what we got was a perfect chaos and weird, hard to predict effects like:

* Negative Oil Prices
* Liquidity bubbles in Housing, Stocks, Sneakers etc.
* Weird shifts in demand due to work from home and 7 Billion people changing their lifestyle completely, all at once.
* Used cars costing more than new cars,
* GPU's retailing for 3x the normal price.
* A global shortage of Toilet paper.
* An insane shortage and price bubble in Lumber and construction prices.

This send shocks up and  down the supply chain. As today prices very dependent on expectation of tomorrows prices, it caused a lot of distortions. Very similar to how the stock market works where future expectations make up 90% of the whole valuation. So with everyone guessing hard what will happen next, the next you can end up with something like this:

[The bullwhip effect \(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bullwhip\_effect\)](https://preview.redd.it/lzcp3idsfq891.png?width=1875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4714ea3f260649e489936e4cf4ef4544438199)

As our good friend Michael J. Burry points out here so nicely is, that the dog has a really long tail, and that the predictions of all the market participants when it comes to inventory, prices and supply drive a really, really long tail.

**This brings us to the problem of measurement.** As you might have heard, the means to measure inflation predate the second world war and not really doing a good job or even attempt to model the chaotic nature of reality described above. You buy a couple things that are roughly the same each month (**CPI**), you try to smoothen it a bit by  excluding strongly fluctuating (Food, Energy) items (**Core CPI)** you ask about of producers how the are feeling about the economy (**PPI**) and then you can estimate where you are **right now.** You can try to make a prediction by drawing the line a bit further out but this is as helpful as technical analysis on penny stocks that we all are so tired off.

One should keep in mind that these are simplified mental model based on our incomplete information of the parameters involved and the inability of the human mind to grasp the incredible complexity of large scale, chaotic systems. Or as my good friend Jerome Powel uttered on yesterday

&amp;#x200B;

[We overshot a tiny little bit, maybe.](https://preview.redd.it/15jexiqvfq891.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a859f20c5b60f96bfce983473aaa6d75ac5c035)

&gt;**Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell admits 'we now understand better how little we understand about inflation' and insists 41-year high prices were 'unpredicted'**  
&gt;  
&gt;[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html)

So what that all really means is that the inflation we are measuring today, is something that potentially is caused by effects that are long past us. Due to the nature of long, intertwined supply chains and relatively comprehensive disruptions of shipping and transportation markets, we really have no clue when and how today's numbers where actually made.

**So, if nobody knows anything at all,** why am I even even reading this?

The answer is, **that there are clues of what happens next.** In order to get a feeling where we are right now, lets have a look of the start of any (physical) supply chain, commodities:

[Coming down good already. ](https://preview.redd.it/dt59g0u8gq891.png?width=2629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d01abacc2bc2f5dcbeb4defb2125ebd88cc7d5)

As you can see, these are **not charts of runaway prices.** There are of course spikes, for instance in lithium but commodities as a whole have relaxed quite a bit from the recent peaks.

Lets have a look at some shit people are actually buying instead of some made-up basket from the last century.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Shipping cost is on the retreat too \(https:\/\/fbx.freightos.com\/\)](https://preview.redd.it/wmg94b4pgq891.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44c485bb7ec8b9bf0b2f28bf3b3108b0907297f6)

&amp;#x200B;

So these are just some isolated (and of course cherry picked) examples but it should illustrate that things are a little (**a lot**) more nuanced than the red-hot monthly readings are suggesting. It might actually be, that inflation **has already peaked and the worst is behind us**. Which leads us to the most interesting question:

**Should I buy calls or puts now?** Well, this really depends. As you maybe know, the fed uses interest rates to accelerate or brake the economy by making money cheaper or more difficult to borrow (in simple terms). This works because the more money you have,  the more shit you can trade and make and buy. Less money is taking the oxygen out of the room. Lets overlay the fed balance sheet (which is a reasonable benchmark for money supply) with the SP500 to see if we can spot any correlation (how much two lines like each other)

[A little bit of overlap, maybe \(https:\/\/www.currentmarketvaluation.com\/posts\/2021\/07\/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php\) ](https://preview.redd.it/zscck4ovgq891.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3baab1ae3556e87b0bfebdd9a92252e310e90e4)

&amp;#x200B;

As we can see they are somewhat correlated. So to summarize:

**When inflation numbers are high**, the Fed raises rates in order the choke the economy a bit. As a consequence the price of shit goes down or at least does not raise anymore.

**When inflation numbers are low**, the fed can push the pedal a bit more and make money more widely available. This makes everyone a bit richer and stimulates the economy. This is desirable as it means more jobs and more shit to buy, in general.

Historically the markets are relatively resilient. They survived the great depression, world wars, oil shocks, wars and what not. Generally investors are fine as long as they have a feeling where things are going. Right now, nobody really knows shit and these inflation readings are the number everyone is focussing on because it will in last consequence mean the difference between another bull mania or a long and painful bear market.

**So should I buy puts are calls now for fucks sake?**

Easy.

**If you take the blue pill** you are on **Team Bear Gang**, you submit to the great uncertainty and you are scared of runway inflation. **You buy PUTS** because you believe it will be necessary to kill the economy for a quarter or two to bring down inflation.

**If you take the red pill** you are on **Team Burry** and make the bold contrarian bet that inflation has already peaked and it is likely that we see a nice reversal, especially in the battered down tech sector (Zuck, I still love you). **You buy CALLS** because you buy when there is blood in the streets and the worst is already behind us.

**It you take the pill with the Mitsubishy Logo** you are team smooth-brain and believe it does not matter, because we will have a strong reaction either way and the **VIX** at **29** is super low, considering the uncertainty that we are facing currently. **So you buy PUTS and CALLS** because the market will either go to shit like 2008 and we did so nothing yet, or we have another face-ripping rally like in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Nobody knows what is going to happen but there is opportunity in guessing how wrong we are about inflation.

wallstreetbet,"The retards guide to inflation**Listen Up,**

before you pop your morning dose of Adderall and give your wifes boyfriend a foot massage, let me clue you in on something really important.  The masters of the Economy (And hence the remainders of your tech portfolio) are shit scared of inflation. Jerome Powell, The Fed, Charlie Munger, Biden, Wallstreet and everybody else is shit-scared of inflation. **Your mother is scared of inflation** (How will she pay for your Wetabix and XBox games tomorrow?). 

What is inflation though? Common knowledge is, that **it is the increase of price levels by a surplus of money or a shortage of things**. Too much money, chasing too few things = stuff gets more expensive, too little money, too many things: stuff get cheaper. 

So far so easy, there is however a psychological component to it. Companies adjust prices and production preemptively based on their future expectations. In order to protect their inventory and shield themselves from compressed margins they might produce way more than forecasted or adjust forward pricing based on their expectations on their rising cost and higher sales prices. . Producers might start hoarding parts as they might be more difficult to obtain down the road. The great chip shortage appears to be greatly intensified due to the fact that everyone and their mother order way more than than they need just to ensure the other guy is not snatching their inventory. 

This is a really hard problem to tackle in times of super intricate global supply chains that try to get everything just in time because warehouses and inventory are surprisingly expensive. (This is also why Amazon will rather burn your returns than deal with them with any degree of intimacy). So as a business owner you have to predict the demand for your stuff, the availability of the stuff you need, the prices of the stuff you need etc. **SUPER HARD**. Remember, everybody has to do it for themselves and the guess what the others are doing. So like when people are rushing into a stock, you have these self-reinforcing systems. (George Soros calls this ""Reflexivity""). This worked surprisingly well for the last 30 years. There is only one issue, the whole organism of global trade is much more fragile than anyone expected. So when this happened: 

[Shitshow TM, curtesy global events since 2020 ](https://preview.redd.it/ejgw21n50q891.png?width=1647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b03009da35b05d0239db824d4bf9dd4c8d23838)

The models did not really capture the dynamic nature of reality completely. The infinite money glitch from the fed was just the icing on the cake. So what we got was a perfect chaos and weird, hard to predict effects like: 

* Negative Oil Prices
* Liquidity bubbles in Housing, Stocks, Sneakers etc. 
* Weird shifts in demand due to WFH and 7 Billion people changing their lifestyle completely, all at once. 
* Used cars costing more than new cars, 
* GPU's retailing for 3x the normal price. 
* A global shortage of Toilet paper. 
* An insane shortage and price bubble in Lumber and construction prices. 

This send shocks up and  down the supply chain. As today prices very dependent on expectation of tomorrows prices, it caused a lot of distortions. Very similar to how the stock market works where future expectations make up 90% of the whole valuation. So with everyone guessing hard what will happen next, the next you can end up with something like this: 

[The bullwhip effect \(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bullwhip\_effect\) ](https://preview.redd.it/aop33had2q891.png?width=2105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8877a75b8f4df0f6610666ad6597ff8932a7c956)

As our good friend Michael J. Burry points out here so nicely is, that the dog has a really long tail, and that the predictions of all the market participants when it comes to inventory, prices and supply drive a really, really long tail. 

**This brings us to the problem of measurement.** As you might have heard, the means to measure inflation predate the second world war and not really doing a good job or even attempt to model the chaotic nature of reality described above. You buy a couple things that are roughly the same each month (**CPI**), you try to smoothen it a bit by  excluding strongly fluctuating (Food, Energy) items (**Core CPI)** you ask about of producers how the are feeling about the economy (**PPI**) and then you can estimate where you are **right now.** You can try to make a prediction by drawing the line a bit further out but this is as helpful as technical analysis on penny stocks that we all are so tired off. 

One should keep in mind that these are simplified mental model based on our incomplete information of the parameters involved and the inability of the human mind to grasp the incredible complexity of large scale, chaotic systems. Or as my good friend Jerome Powel uttered on yesterday 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell admits 'we now understand better how little we understand about inflation' and insists 41-year high prices were 'unpredicted'**  
&gt;  
&gt;[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html)

[We overshot a tiny little bit, maybe.](https://preview.redd.it/1ao6y3kcvp891.png?width=1969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=828b22c02a5b9dccabc51cf7d0567fbcbad9f34e)

So what that all really means is that the inflation we are measuring today, is something that potentially is caused by effects that are long past us. Due to the nature of long, intertwined supply chains and relatively comprehensive disruptions of shipping and transportation markets, we really have no clue when and how today's numbers where actually made. 

**So, if nobody knows anything at all,** why am I even even reading this? 

The answer is, **that there are clues of what happens next.** In order to get a feeling where we are right now, lets have a look of the start of any (physical) supply chain, commodities: 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, these are **not charts of runaway prices.** There are of course spikes, for instance in lithium but commodities as a whole have relaxed quite a bit from the recent peaks. 

Lets have a look at some shit people are actually buying instead of some made-up basket from the last century.

So these are just some isolated (and of course cherry picked) examples but it should illustrate that things are a little (**a lot**) more nuanced than the red-hot monthly readings are suggesting. It might actually be, that inflation **has already peaked and the worst is behind us**. Which leads us to the most interesting question: 

**Should I buy calls or puts now?** Well, this really depends. As you maybe know, the fed uses interest rates to accelerate or brake the economy by making money cheaper or more difficult to borrow (in simple terms). This works because the more money you have,  the more shit you can trade and make and buy. Less money is taking the oxygen out of the room. Lets overlay the fed balance sheet (which is a reasonable benchmark for money supply) with the SP500 to see if we can spot any correlation (how much two lines like each other) 

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.currentmarketvaluation.com\/posts\/2021\/07\/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php](https://preview.redd.it/of0w8n4t9q891.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db97fad794bc7b492506a02f92ee13419b4edb8f)

As we can see they are somewhat correlated. So to summarize: 

**When inflation numbers are high**, the Fed raises rates in order the choke the economy a bit. As a consequence the price of shit goes down or at least does not raise anymore. 

**When inflation numbers are low**, the fed can push the pedal a bit more and make money more widely available. This makes everyone a bit richer and stimulates the economy. This is desirable as it means more jobs and more shit to buy, in general. 

Historically the markets are relatively resilient. They survived the great depression, world wars, oil shocks, wars and what not. Generally investors are fine as long as they have a feeling where things are going. Right now, nobody really knows shit and these inflation readings are the number everyone is focussing on because it will in last consequence mean the difference between another bull mania or a long and painful bear market. 

**So should I buy puts are calls now for fucks sake?** 

Easy. 

**If you take the blue pill** you are on **Team Bear Gang**, you submit to the great uncertainty and you are scared of runway inflation. **You buy PUTS** because you believe it will be necessary to kill the economy for a quarter or two to bring down inflation. 

**If you take the red pill** you are on **Team Burry** and make the bold contrarian bet that inflation has already peaked and it is likely that we see a nice reversal, especially in the battered down tech sector (Zuck, I still love you). **You buy CALLS** because you buy when there is blood in the streets and the worst is already behind us. 

**It you take the pill with the Mitsubishy Logo** you are team smooth-brain and believe it does not matter, because we will have a strong reaction either way and the **VIX** at **29** is super low, considering the uncertainty that we are facing currently. **So you buy PUTS and CALLS** because the market will either go to shit like 2008 and we did so nothing yet, or we have another face-ripping rally like in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Nobody knows what is going to happen but there is opportunity in guessing how wrong we are about inflation. 

**Position:** 

* 5x ARKG JAN 20' 23 30 Put @ $2.6 
* 110 Shares of VOO @ 261 

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER**: I have no idea about any of this shit and this DD is just prose. So check everything and invert yourself. This is a casino."

wallstreetbet,"Netflix lays off 300 more employees as revenue growth slowsNetflix is laying off around 300 more employees across the company.

&amp;#x200B;

The cuts, which represent about 3% of total employees, come about a month after the streaming company eliminated about 150 positions in the wake of its first subscriber loss in a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúToday we sadly let go of around 300 employees,‚Äù Netflix said in a statement Thursday. ‚ÄúWhile we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth. We are so grateful for everything they have done for Netflix and are working hard to support them through this difficult transition.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Netflix had warned investors in April that it would be pulling back on some of its spending growth over the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Spencer Neumann, the company‚Äôs chief financial officer, said during the company‚Äôs earnings call that Netflix is trying to be ‚Äúprudent‚Äù about pulling back to to reflect the realities of its business. The company still plans to invest heavily, including around $17 billion on content.

&amp;#x200B;

Co-CEO Reed Hastings also said during the call that the company is exploring lower-priced, ad-supported tiers in a bid to bring in new subscribers after years of resisting advertisements on the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Netflix is working to crack down on rampant password sharing as well. The company said that in addition to its 222 million paying households, more than 100 million households use its service through account sharing.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of the company were down less than a percent during midday trading Thursday, but are down more around 70% since January.

wallstreetbet,"Air BnBubble? Is it possible it could be as bad as the 2008 housing crash?Right now, analysts are focusing on historically low housing inventory levels. Inventory levels are based on the average number of active listings and pending sales on the market.

With inventory levels being so low, analysts purport that there is no way we could see a 2008-style crash in home prices. But nobody seems to be focusing on the Air BnBubble. If all of those hosts get thin profit margins, or just see a potential to sell high and re-buy low like us degenerates, the market could change quickly.

wallstreetbet,"Powell says no guarantee of soft landing for U.S. economy...Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday said there was no guarantee that the central bank can engineer a soft landing for the U.S. economy. ‚ÄúWe think that there are pathways for us to achieve the path back to 2% inflation while still retaining a strong labor market. We believe we can do that,‚Äù Powell said, during a panel discussion with other top heads of central banks at a European Central Bank policy conference in Sintra, Portugal. Powell quickly added that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no guarantee that we can do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously something that‚Äôs going to be quite challenging,‚Äù he added, only made more difficult by ‚Äúthe events of the last few months‚Äù such as the war in Ukraine. Despite the contraction of economic growth in the first three months of the year, Powell was upbeat about the current health of the economy. Households and businesses were in very strong shape and the labor market is ‚Äútremendously strong,‚Äù he said.

In fact, the Fed is engineering slower growth ‚Äî ‚Äúgrowth moderate,‚Äù as he said ‚Äî a necessary adjustment to let supply catch up with strong demand. ‚ÄúIs there a risk we can go too far? Certainly there is a risk,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I wouldn‚Äôt agree that it‚Äôs the biggest risk to the economy.‚Äù The ‚Äúbiggest mistake‚Äù would be to fail to restore price stability,‚Äù he said.

The Fed ‚Äúwill not allow a transition from a low inflation environment into a high inflation environment,‚Äù Powell said. The Fed needs to get its benchmark policy rate ‚Äúinto restrictive territory fairly quickly,‚Äù he said.

wallstreetbet,"Free Options ToolHey everyone, I recently made content on my YouTube about how to trade options.  I credit the bull of this strategy to Charlie‚Äôs vids but anyways I took it and made it into a Tradingview indicator. It works based off IV and RSI. Many people starting out with options ignore IV or buy way Out of the Money. For this strategy I would like for you to focus on In the Money options only and try to acquire them at a low Implied Volatility. But wait I cannot read a chart or know whatever half the stuff you just said is‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt worry I made a tool to dumb this down. The RSI is at the bottom in white, when it rips above yellow it‚Äôs over bought below yellow line is oversold and the IV line is overlaid in red/green when IV is too high it‚Äôs green and when it‚Äôs low it‚Äôs red. We want to sell options either naked or positions we hold when IV is high and buy when low. I‚Äôve printed call and put symbols on the chart for you all to see and to ignore IV and RSI if you want to.

wallstreetbet,"I figured out the planI was watching kitboga mess with scammers dwelling on my 4k bbby shares wondering wtf has been going on and I suddenly started to put together why Cohen picked the call strikes as they seem hopeless with no real pathway to victory. 

Cohen wrote in his original letter: ‚ÄúGiven that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023‚Äù (heads up Q4 showed 1.4B sales in 2021) 

He also wrote: ‚Äúwe estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis‚Äù 

Ctrl f it up:

https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf


Double digit earnings multiple:

‚Äúthe average revenue multiple for startup valuation is 1x ‚Äì 5x for startups that are growing very slowly (~10% per year), 6x ‚Äì 10x for startups that are growing in the lower two digits (30-40% per year), and 10x ‚Äì 20x for tech startups that are growing in the three digits (300-400% per year).‚Äù

https://microcap.co/startup-valuation-revenue-multiple/#What_Startup_Valuation_Revenue_Multiple_Should_I_Use

Lets assume low double digit earnings multiple or even more conservative and use the high end of single digit multiple (5). 

Since BBBY did 1.4B in sales for 2021 this is 1.4Bx5=5.6B or 70/share. 

Its clear this must be what he saw because 1.5Bx5 = 93.75/share. This level is what justified his strike prices because the company would gain this in value just intrinsically.

Do I have to purchase 500 shares of AMC for whatever price it lands on? Let's say it's $13 for $6,500 + the $400 premium for a total of $6,900 or do I just lose that $400 premium and I don't actually buy the 500 shares?

wallstreetbet,"Mester, Williams, Daly, and Powell. Here's what they have to say as of lately**Mester**

 Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said the U.S. central bank is on track for another big interest-rate rise next month based on current economic conditions.

If the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting was being held today, Ms. Mester said Wednesday on CNBC that she would advocate for a 0.75-percentage-point rate increase ‚Äúbecause I haven‚Äôt seen the kind of numbers on the inflation side that I need to see in order to, you know, think that we can go back to a 50 \[basis-point\] increase.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just at the beginning of the rate rises, really,‚Äù Ms. Mester said. For this year, ‚ÄúI think getting interest rates up to that three to three and a half percent is really important‚Äù as part of the effort to lower inflation, which could take some time. 

**Williams**

 On Tuesday, New York Fed leader John Williams said a rate rise of between half and three quarters of a percentage point is on the table for the July 26-27 FOMC meeting. He also doubts Fed actions will send the economy into a downturn, and said in a CNBC interview that ‚Äúmy base case is the economy slows enough to see the unemployment rate get up to about a little over 4% over the next couple of years,‚Äù compared with its current 3.6% reading. 

**Daly**

 San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly discussed the inflation outlook and her support for a 0.75-percentage-point rate increase at the central bank‚Äôs June 14-15 policy meeting during a conference call.  Ms. Mester said there are times when supply-shock-driven inflation surges ‚Äúcould threaten the stability of inflation expectations and would require policy action.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt say that such a view applies to current circumstances.   

**Powell**

 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was more concerned about the risk of failing to stamp out high inflation than about the possibility of raising interest rates too high and pushing the economy into a recession. 

 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a clock running here,‚Äù Mr. Powell said during a moderated discussion Wednesday at the European Central Bank‚Äôs annual economic policy conference in Portugal. ‚ÄúThe risk is that because of the multiplicity of shocks, you start to transition into a higher-inflation regime. Our job is literally to prevent that from happening, and we will prevent that from happening.‚Äù"

wallstreetbet,"Cooper Standard Holdings (CPS) Deeeeeeeep Value PlayI‚Äôll keep this short, since my thesis has already been covered by others.


This is not financial advice‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know your circumstances, but this is what I‚Äôm doing.

CPS.  If you are familiar with Munger‚Äôs play on Tenneco in 2001, this is the same play.

Auto suppliers have very sticky revenues, and right now demand remains high for new cars.

Chip shortages and supply chain issues have crushed new car volumes, causing CPS to take on a ton of debt(less than Tenneco in 2001 though) and lose money.  Revenues are on the decline and the market has priced them incredibly harshly.  New car production is expected to stay low for the rest of the year and slightly in to next year. 

This has a reasonable probability to be a generational opportunity in my view.  

CPS is the #1 provider for sealing systems in the world ,  OEMs desperately need CPS to stay in business.

This will allow CPS to raise prices on them, as indicated in the last earnings call.  As chip shortages ease, supply will catch up with demand and CPS will return to profitability.

This is a company that had positive operating cash flows up until 2019.

In a normal functioning market for them, they were generating &gt;$100m in FCF per year on roughly $3bn in revenues.  Market cap is currently around $80million. 

If/when they survive the current disaster, they will return to even higher FCF based on all the useless assets they‚Äôve sold off and operational efficiencies they‚Äôve adjusted for to survive.

Revenues are still above $2bn/yr, and will likely be over $2.5bn this year.  They were cash flow positive in March 2022, Q2 is looking tough, but losses should improve compared to Q1 2022 and Q4 2021.  P/B is 0.33.

Near term catalyst this is year: If they are able to successfully refinance some of their debt through the recent Goldman Sachs hire, that alone will take bankruptcy off the table.

Management are highly incentivized to be shareholder friendly since a large portion of their comp is tied to ROIC and is SBC.   Not only that, they‚Äôve been buying their own stock as of late. Despite having reduced incomes due to the companie‚Äôs poor performance, they are still buying their own stock.  

They recently sold a property in Germany for $50m, which was more than they expected to get for it, so hopefully their remaining high quality assets are more valuable than what they report them at.  Don‚Äôt count on that, but it would be nice.  


CPS went bankrupt in 2008 because the auto manufacturers weren‚Äôt selling new cars.  Demand was low and since the auto manufacturers themselves were going bankrupt, they had no incentive to keep CPS alive.    Situation is completely different right now. 

In my view, there is a reasonable chance this will be a 5-20 bagger, and the downside risk is worth the gamble.

Long term catalyst:  New car volumes expected to increase roughly 10% by 2025-2026.  



Risks:  They could go broke.  New car production volumes stay low for more than 3 years, chip shortages do not get better, they fail to refinance debt, and go bankrupt.  If things keep getting worse, or do not improve, bankruptcy could happen by late ~2024.  

They are a takeover candidate.  Investors could get fucked if an activist investor or larger company comes in and buys the whole company for $10/share.

Even though the stock is down 98% from the ath, it could go down another 98%

The market cap is so small right now that the big smart money is not able to take a position, even if they wanted to.  If a turnaround starts to take shape, those funds will begin to pile in.  Since we are working with far less capital than them, we are fortunate enough to be able to own opportunities like this one. 

Great company, ridiculously cheap price.

- Last time DFV showed his spreadsheets, he owned this company
- Great Hill Capital has taken a &gt;2% stake in the company at sub $5 prices and they are deep deep value guys.
- Towle owned it. Sold it some time in early 2022, but don‚Äôt be surprised if the next 13F shows a new position in CPS.  It‚Äôs possible it had to be made so small they didn‚Äôt have to report it too. 
- healthy amount of insider buying.

Or they see price going down and as soon as they buy puts,  the price starts going up . Again they purchase those puts right into a support level. 

I know you are probably not the brightest tool in shed, you are probably on your break from flipping burgers and don‚Äôt have much time but listen to me technical analysis works it‚Äôs just you are getting your information from morons probably from WSB. The crayon lines you are looking probably are drawn by idiotic barely intelligible functioning members of society. People that you probably run away in real life or at least ignore. Okay they might be 2-3 people here in WSB who know technical analysis. 

So you don‚Äôt know anything about technical analysis. You have a little of money to gamble. You work hard at Wendy‚Äôs. This is your hard earn money. Your tired of been poor.  You decided to buy options. Give yourself a chance with those options. Is there someone out there that could help you? Luckily for you , there is a nerd that publishes accurate support/resistance levels.  His name Adam Mancini. With over 134k followers he publishes support/resistance levels for ES daily in his twitter account. Okay I should explain this since you are probably slow . ES [SP futures] is almost identical to SP [ Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index ] during normal trading sessions. And SPY [SPDR S&amp;P 500 SPY ETF] tracks SP . I know what you will say ‚Äúthat nerd who draws crayon lines is trying to sell me a newsletter for $23 a month‚Äù. For you probably that is a lot of money , working your minimum wage job. You don‚Äôt need it. I am a subscriber. I find it very useful and educational . Adam provides support/resistance levels, bear scenario, bull scenario, his trading plan and his strategy. You are here in WSB, to trade like Adam you need a brain , need to be disciplined, need to be sophisticated, need to be able to read price action , need to be patient. You are working at Wendy‚Äôs, you are not a trader you are a gambler. Okay so his levels useless to me? No mate, please read the following for you to understand.


A support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers. This means that the price is more likely to ""bounce"" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level . 

A resistance level is the opposite of a support level . This means that there are more sellers than buyers. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to ""bounce"" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level . 

A previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up, and conversely, a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back. 


Once an area or ""zone"" of support or resistance has been identified, those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because, as a price reaches a point of support or resistance, it will do one of two things‚Äîbounce back away from the support or resistance level (trading ranges), or violate the price level and continue in its direction (trading breakouts) ‚Äîuntil it hits the next support or resistance level 

The basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sell/sell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down. Buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off, but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold. Therefore, consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area 

Trading breakouts, a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset's price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume . The first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points. Once the asset trades beyond the price barrier, volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout's direction. Breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases, large price swings and, in many circumstances, major price trends. When trading breakouts, it is important to consider the underlying asset's support and resistance levels. The more times an asset price has touched these areas, the more valid these levels are and the more important they become. At the same time, the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play, the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out. Asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to. This doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it is called a false breakout. Therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts. 

Markets regularly cycle between clean trend, and choppy consolidation, spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall. Usually after a large move in market , a consolidation phase occurs. After choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken. 

Everyone focuses on being smart. 
But not being stupid is actually more important. Not being stupid is essential for survival. Do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support. Do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance.  Do not buy options when market consolidating. Do not bet it all in one move . You might get lucky and win big but eventually you will lose big. Is better to trade level to level with proper size position using risk management.

Buy calls when strong resistance shatters. Buy puts when strong support fails. Buy options during breakouts when market is trending. Remember after large move expect market to consolidate to be in range for a day or two.

 I probably will regret this but I will answer any question regarding support/resistance levels.

Last week I purchased 400 shares of $PTON and sold 28 and 29 calls (2 each) expiring on Feb 4.   When $PTON closed at \~24.60 on Friday I thought these calls would expire worthless.  I was happy to hear about takeover rumors for $PTON with the stock trading above $32.00 in afterhours trading.

Today I was surprised to see my options in fact had been called on Friday !!!    Since you cannot trade options at 4 pm I was puzzled.

Performing a quick Google Search I found out if you own the call options you can in fact exercise those options until 5:30 (EST) on the day of the expiring option.

Opinion Here - If you were trying to scam the market, you can buy a bunch or worthless options for pennies just before the closing bell on a Friday,   start a false rumor,   exercise the options and sell at a higher price on Monday morning.   Just saying, how sure can we be about this rumor for $PTON.

wallstreetbet,"New way to buy put options on the oil sector.I have a theory that I am found a new and better way to buy put options on the oil sector buy only buying a few gallons at a day. I fill up every morning just a few gallons to get me to work and back and never fill up. I can for sure afford to fill up because I make over $100,000 a year. I‚Äôm buying puts because I‚Äôm betting that the next day gas will be cheaper. So for example I bought 3 gallons of gas Friday, then Saturday it‚Äôs $.10 cheaper. I buy 3 more gallons on Saturday and I make $0.30 on the options put.  The money  I‚Äôm gaining I then saving that money in my wife‚Äôs boyfriends piggy Bank so that he can take my wife out to nicer dates. So far this week I‚Äôve been able to save up enough for them to have a nice day out in the park with some BK 10 for $1.49 chicken nuggets. 

Eventually if enough people catch on and use this strategy I think we can cause another history short squeeze on the oil sector. It will also cause oil companies to be scared because everyone will only fill up 1-2 gallons a day instead of the 10-15 gallons they are used to. This will decrease stock price because demand is lower and we can rally the apes to go all in on oil. The boomers will never see it coming"

Target of $265 by 2/18. This would yield $800k, which is about $615k in profits. Today was definitely not a great start to the week and set my [identical play from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skf2dd/zucks_going_to_make_me_a_millionaire/) back by almost 50%. I used it as an opportunity to bring down my cost basis, though, by adding an additional 225 contracts for $3.50.

Underlying justification for the trade remains the same. I'm anticipating that by 2/18 FB will gain back a third of what was lost during Thursday and Friday next week. That would put us at $265. Recovery play, plain and simple.

There are many reasons why I see Crude Oil hitting $100 this year:

* OPEC members are currently struggling to meet current monthly targets and lack the capacity to expand output levels even further.

* Oil supplies are looking tighter than many had anticipated, while demand is increasing. 

* High global Inflation 

* Russia‚Äôs conflict with Ukraine

&gt;Digital Turbine: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another one of those *creative video situations*. I got like 70 of them. At least it makes money. But there‚Äôs just too many of them. 

I don't know how much coke he's been doing, but APPS is an end-to-end, one-stop advertising and monetizing platform. They recently acquired [Appreciate](https://www.appreciate.mobi/#!/home#smart-dsp), [AdColony](https://www.adcolony.com/) and [Fyber](https://www.fyber.com/) so they're literally in every step of advertising now. Buy side, sell side, and in between.

Oh yeah, and they report earnings tomorrow (Tuesday) after close. Look at similar ad-centered companies like GOOG and SNAP to get an idea of how APPS might do... just sayin'.

We all know, MSFT proposed to acquire ATVI at $95 per share before FY 2023. However, ATVI is current locked below $80 for extended period of time. There‚Äôs only one single reason for such huge price difference, the fear of regulatory intervention. 

From a financial point of view, the biggest all-cash acquisition certainly guarantees antitrust investigation. Even more so if you only consider the console market, as US personale usually do. But if you know gaming industry, as most apes do, it‚Äôs easy to conclude that the deal will ultimately go through without much fuzz, for the following reasons:

1. The post acquisition Microsoft will only be the third biggest gaming company across all platforms behind Sony and Tecent. 
2. Gaming industry is highly fragmental in nature. The combined revenue of Microsoft and Activision are only in the middle teen of the whole gaming market including console, PC and the fragmental mobile gaming. 
3. Microsoft has promised to honoured all past cross platform deals. Antitrust based on pure speculation doesn‚Äôt holds water.

In conclusion, there‚Äôs no real antitrust angle. The deal will go through.

There isn‚Äôt any yolo potential. But ATVI is an ideal diversification in a tumbling market."

wallstreetbet,"We can Now Make Money On Airlines $ULCCThe Merger between $SAVE Spirit Airlines and $ULCC Frontier makes the Fifth Largest - the opportunity for us to earn airlines is NOW - Diamond Hands???

Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, the two largest low-cost carriers in the U.S. have agreed to merge, creating what would become the fifth-largest airline in the country. The boards of both companies approved the deal over the weekend, prior to the CEOs of both airlines announcing the agreement in New York City. 

Each company represents a good investment in my opinion, yet together it makes more sense to buy $ULCC in the down mode, like them for $12 - Current Market Cap $2.7 Billion with a 52-week high of $22.70 - The Margin of profitability is huge in at $12 - Diamond Hands... social sentiment is growing around Price Targets close to $50.... I am liking what I have read, the DD I have done and the results of my research $ULCC and The Options Opportunity is worth taking a Look at

 The deal, valued at $6.6 billion, is structured with Frontier Airlines controlling 51.5% of the merged airline while Spirit will hold the remaining 48.5%. Spirit investors will receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each Spirit share they own. The companies say the deal implies a value of $25.83 per Spirit share, which would be a 19% premium over the value of Spirit shares at the end of last week."

wallstreetbet,"Majority Trading: US stocks may rebound violently in February, and there is still 13% room for rise before the end of the yearTom Lee, co-founder and research director of fundstrat global advisors, a US investment institution, recently released a research report that after the sharp decline in the new year and the recent performance of a series of large technology stocks shook investor confidence, with a large amount of cash returning to the market, the US stock market may rebound strongly in February.

He explained that this is because the market has digested a lot of bad news, especially after the bad performance of technology companies such as Facebook's parent companies meta platforms and paypal led to a one-day decline of up to 25%.

""The sharp fall in Facebook's share price did not negate the basic prediction of a violent rebound in February,"" Lee said. ""For me, when the market is so fragile and tense, there is a higher possibility of positive surprises. The terrible decline in the market in January laid the foundation for the strong trend in February. The faster the decline, the faster the rebound.""

He added that the growing pessimism of retail investors in recent weeks was actually a reverse signal that the stock market was about to rebound rapidly. Retail investors have raised a lot of cash, giving them ammunition to re-enter the market after they think the worst is over.

In addition, he also pointed out that the relative strength index has fallen to the lowest level since the sale in March 2020, indicating that investors have sold too much, are sending a ""buy signal"" and maintaining the target level of the S &amp; P 500 index at 5100 at the end of the year. Considering that the S &amp; P 500 index closed at 4500.53 on Friday, this means that there is still room for a rise of 13.3%.

""Overall, although 2022 has a bad start, we don't think it is a harbinger of poor performance throughout the year.""

The U.S. stock market fluctuated in trading on Friday, with the S &amp; P 500 index and Nasdaq index closing higher. The NASDAQ index recovered most of the losses of the previous trading day, as Amazon's strong performance put an end to the mixed results of large technology stocks.

Goldman Sachs: resisting the temptation of stabilization of small cap stocks in the United States, the earnings of large cap stocks are better

Goldman Sachs strategist David kostin's team recently released a research report, warning investors who are tempted by signs of stabilization of medium and small cap stocks in US stocks. Goldman Sachs believes that the tightening of the US financial environment, the slowdown of economic growth and the flattening of the US bond yield curve may ""depress"" the return of the Russell 2000 index (representing small and medium-sized stocks) relative to the S &amp; P 500 index (representing large cap stocks).

The kostin index shows that the return rate of the past two years will continue to lag behind the kostin index in 2022. Citing Goldman's model, he pointed out that the small stock index could rise by 7% in the next 12 months, while the expected return of the S &amp; P 500 index at the end of the year was 14%.

However, JPMorgan analyst Marko kolanovic suggested buying small cap stocks. The valuations of these stocks mean they are unlikely to bear, he said.

In addition, Julian Emanuel, strategist at evercore ISI, also pointed out that the trend of the Russell 2000 index also had an impact on the market. ""Small stocks have shown signs of falling below the previous support level. The recent performance of the Russell 2000 index is a leading indicator of the weakness of the market, and we will pay close attention to the market's response to this level."""

wallstreetbet,"This could be WSB's greatest hour. Snap out of itApes, Romans, Countrymen. Lend me your ears.

Wake the FUCK up WSB. I come to you today bruised and battered like countless other degens who frequent this forum. The last few months we've seen our favorite holdings utterly crushed, with more negativity and more shorts piling in every single day. The assumed narrative at the moment is that any ""risky/growthy"" stock can be shorted without any clap back, morale is at all time lows, and the narrative is that the only stocks that work are already profitable, established companies.

And the apes, in large part, have accepted this as the new truth.

Then, Thursday, after the bell. There was SNAP, there was UNITY, There was PINTEREST. Oh yeah, AMZN too. But there's one more thing here sitting in plain sight: Potential. WAY more potential than you fuckers even realize right now.

Why? Just look at what has happened with Snapchat. BEFORE EARNING EVEN REPORTED, we saw complete capitulation of the stock, total give up.  The sentiment could not be any worse short of an all out stock market crash. But when Snap reported and crushed expectations, the clap back was legendary, and it's evident many shorts got burned badly as they scrambled to cover and likely continue to do so. But this isn't about SNAP, it's about morale over here and seeing clearly what is happening now.

Let's take a second and think about where we find ourselves: What about the current moment in this market? There's inflationary fears, negative sentiment abounds, historic volatility, Jerome's printer is jammed, and the market is packed to the tits with shorting. It's seen as free money by many now to just bet on the fall of the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the winds of change are coming.

\*Slams gorilla fist\*

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS CRUCIAL: What you fucking NITWITS need to realize is that we are in the PERFECT MARKET for wallstreetbets at this exact moment in time. This whole market, with it's historic volatility, is the definition of a powder keg. Buying of put options is near record highs. What SNAP, U, PINS, and others have shown us is that the downside greed has horribly mispriced many stocks out there, and if sentiment about those names shifts, there can be carnage to those who have gotten too greedy and only want the market to go through cycles of accelerated pump and dump with retail mostly left holding the bag. Fuck that.

""But... what if there's a dotcom level crash?""

Fucker, have you been paying no attention at all? The high growth space has already seen declines equivalent or worse than the dotcom era crash in many of these tickers. Are the apes really going to pay attention to the fancy figures and ""concerns"" of Wall St anyway? An ape buys his shit because he wants to. Period

What Snapchat showed us the last few days is these fuckers are now MORE THAN EVER capable of getting buried alive. Absolutely brutalized. Guys, that happened with a 60B market cap company. Take the fucking blinders off. The truth is, it is INSANELY more dangerous for shorts now than it was even back in January/Feb 2021. There really only need be a match to light that fire. A realization that valuations have been beaten down so much already. Sentiment can change at the drop of a hat, more than people realize.

Consider this my match I'm throwing out there.

wallstreetbet,"Golden Cross &amp; Death Cross Explained#  Golden Cross vs. Death Cross: An Overview

The use of statistical analysis to make trading decisions is the core of [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp). Technical analysts use a ton of data, often in the form of charts, to analyze stocks and markets. At times, the trend lines on these charts curve and cross in ways that form shapes, often given funny names like ""cup with handle,"" ""head and shoulders,"" and ""double top."" Technical traders learn to recognize these common patterns and what they might portend for the future performance of a stock or market.

A¬†[golden cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp) and a¬†[death cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp) are exact opposites. A¬†golden cross indicates a long-term bull market going forward, while a death cross signals a long-term bear market. Both refer to the solid confirmation of a long-term trend by the occurrence of a short-term [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) crossing over a major long-term moving average.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

* A golden cross suggests a long-term bull market going forward, while a death cross suggests a long-term bear market.
* Either crossover is considered more significant when accompanied by high trading volume.
* Once the crossover occurs, the long-term moving average is considered a major support level¬†(in the case of the golden cross) or resistance level¬†(in the instance of the death cross) for the market from that point forward.
* Either cross may occur as a signal of a trend change, but they more frequently occur as a strong confirmation of a change in trend that has already taken place.

# Golden Cross

The golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average to the upside and is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market. Basically, the short-term average trends up faster than the long-term average, until they cross.

There are three stages to a golden cross:

* A downtrend that eventually ends as selling is depleted
* A second stage where the shorter moving average crosses up through the longer moving average
* Finally, the continuing uptrend, hopefully leading to higher prices

# Death Cross

Conversely, a similar downside moving average [crossover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossover.asp) constitutes the death cross and is understood to signal a decisive downturn in a market. The death cross occurs when the short-term average trends down and crosses the long-term average, basically going in the opposite direction of the golden cross.

# Special Considerations

There is some variation of opinion as to precisely what constitutes this meaningful moving average crossover. Some analysts define it as a crossover of the 100-day moving average by the 50-day moving average; others define it as the crossover of the 200-day average by the 50-day average.

Analysts also watch for the crossover occurring on lower time frame charts as confirmation of a strong, ongoing trend. Regardless of variations in the precise definition or the time frame applied, the term always refers to a short-term moving average crossing over a major long-term moving average.

In short, Chegg sucks today. Chegg has always sucked, it is always the last source you consult for an opinion because it's only right about 70% of the time. The only reason they were dominant for so long is because they have an enormous bank of already answered questions. Their service to answer questions in real time is almost useless; if you submit 10 questions you might get 4 back within the hour.

And lately I never even see them in my search results when I'm looking up answers. When they had a huge, super active base submitting questions to them they were able to be pretty competitive. But as their subscribers have dipped, their pre-answered question bank has gotten stale and I just think they're just about useless today.

I currently have a membership since it's only 40 bucks and that pays for itself real fast if I look anything there. But I can't even remember the last time I looked on there, probably during finals weeks in December.

wallstreetbet,"7 years soared 9 times! From being questioned to the king, how did Amazon turn over?Amazon has increased nearly nine times since 2015, with a market value of $1.5 trillion.

In 2014, Amazon's annual loss also made Wall Street doubt whether the company would never be profitable. At a time of pessimism on Wall Street, Amazon's ten-year-old bet began to generate profits in 2015, that is, Amazon cloud. The rapid growth of Amazon cloud shocked Wall Street and doubled Amazon's share price that year.

Amazon cloud has maintained rapid growth in the past five years. According to the latest news, the net sales of Amazon cloud platform in the fourth quarter of 2021 was US $17.78 billion, a year-on-year increase of 40%, while the net sales of this business in 2021 reached US $62.202 billion, a year-on-year increase of 37%.

Long term investment must be matched with companies with long-term thinking. Such companies may not cater to the tastes of the capital market in the short term, but they will bring thick returns in the long term. Analysts believe that the real top experts like Amazon are playing an ""infinite game"", which aims to focus on defeating all competitors and building a unique ecosystem in the long term.

Recently, the annual fee of Amazon gold medal members has increased again, showing its stickiness as a unique ecosystem. The annual fee of Amazon gold medal members in 2005 was $79, which was raised to $99 in 2017 and $119 in 2018. From February 18 this year, Amazon's annual gold medal membership fee has been further increased to $139 a year.

A ten-year bet -- Amazon cloud

Amazon cloud originally used Oracle's relational database to manage Amazon. Com However, Bezos is frustrated that the increasing traffic makes the software overwhelmed and threatens the stability of the website every once in a while. In 2007, Amazon launched the original database of simpledb. When simpledb proved to be too cumbersome and difficult to use, Amazon cloud engineers began to develop dynamodb, which is faster and more flexible and can cope with the huge traffic unique to the Internet. Naifei is the user of the Amazon cloud.

In 2010, when gulabani, head of Amazon cloud, predicted that Amazon would take ten years to succeed in relational databases, Bezos said: ""I bet you need more than ten years, so you'd better start now."" Bezos realized that a strong database would be one of the biggest opportunities for cloud computing, so he greatly increased his budget.

In 2012, Amazon cloud released the data warehouse ""redshift"", which allows companies to analyze their data stored in the cloud; In 2015, it released the relational database ""laser"". ""You know, the importance of names may only account for 3%, but sometimes 3% can decide whether to win or lose,"" Bezos said As Amazon enters the database business, a fierce battle between it and Oracle is inevitable.

Before 2015, Amazon did not disclose the financial details of Amazon cloud. In 2015, Amazon finance department proposed that the revenue contributed by Amazon cloud had been close to 10% of Amazon's total sales, which must be disclosed according to federal law. After the news was disclosed, Amazon's market value rose by nearly 15% in one day, breaking the $200 billion mark for the first time, ending Amazon's history of never making money.

The culture of Amazon cloud is the epitome of Amazon's corporate culture: tenacity, perseverance and focusing on high standards that cannot be achieved. Brad stone, author of Bezos, quoted a former AWS executive as saying: ""we are really good at accepting gold medals while complaining that it is not dazzling enough.""

20 years of consistent betting - playing an unlimited game

""For a long time, we are unprofitable. This is our strategy."" Bezos said so in 1997.

The capital market is naturally a short-term place. Most investors and listed companies only focus on the company's profit maximization and stock price fluctuation, but Amazon is just the opposite, as Natalie Berg, the author of Amazon effect, said.

Bezos's first letter to shareholders in 1997 still reads like it was just written yesterday. In a letter to shareholders in 1997, Bezos said: first of all, we measure ourselves by the relevant indicators of market leading position. The growth of customers and revenue, the repurchase rate of customers and the recognition of brands. We have been and will be actively committed to expanding and doubling our customer base, brand and permanent infrastructure.

Amazon has been doing the same for the past 20 years. Briton Ladd, a former Amazon executive, believes that companies are either playing limited games or unlimited games. In a limited game, related companies believe they can beat their competitors. The characteristic of limited game is to record game scores with a set of rules agreed by all parties and a well-defined mechanism.

Ladd believes that Amazon is playing an unlimited game with the goal of surpassing its competitors. Amazon is well aware that competitors are destined to emerge one after another, and Amazon itself knows that it can't be the best in all fields. Amazon therefore made a strategic decision, that is, to focus on defeating all its competitors and survive, it should create an ecosystem to perfectly meet and serve the expanding needs of consumers for products, services and technologies.

Debenham, a British department store retailer, said that retailers generally reinvest 1% \~ 2% of their revenue in system construction, while Amazon reinvests 6%. ""This is a 5:1 difference, which makes reinvestment give back better toolkits, better testing and better infrastructure."" He said.

""When you run a business with a low profit margin, you really develop a sustainable moat around it."" Mark mahani, general manager and analyst of capital markets at Royal Bank of Canada, said that he has been involved in Internet stocks since 1998. ""Few companies are willing to enter Amazon's core business and try to compete with it with a profit margin of 1% or 2%.""

Natalie Berg said that this is just a retail business. In fact, many non core businesses of Amazon are first-class large loss makers. Amazon may still lose money in express delivery. Terminal devices such as Amazon's e-reader Kindle and smart speaker echo are typically sold at cost or loss. Given that echo owners spend 66% more than Amazon's average shoppers, the retailer is clearly motivated to subsidize the sale of the device.

Long term thinking - continuous innovation on behalf of customers

""If you want to know what makes us different, that's the answer. We're really customer-centric, we're really long-term oriented, and we really love innovation. Most companies don't."" Bezos said.

Amazon is not the first customer-oriented retailer in the world. However, the reason why Amazon is different is that it is not satisfied with the status quo. It always seeks better ways to serve customers and make customers' shopping experience more convenient and faster.

In 2016, Bezos wrote to shareholders that there are many advantages of being customer-centric, but the biggest advantage is that customers can always point out your unexpected dissatisfaction. Although they can't say how to improve, they always expect to get better things, and your desire to please customers can drive you to invent.

Amazon unremittingly innovates on behalf of its customers. In this process, Amazon will not only amaze consumers, but also subvert more industries. Natalie Berg said that Amazon is not a real retailer. It is a technology company whose sole purpose is to innovate on behalf of customers' needs. However, it sells a lot of things in the process."

wallstreetbet,"Uber holdings and EPSAfter we all got conned by Amazon when they counted their Rivian stake as part of their earnings, I was looking into Uber (reporting this week). Uber has stakes in several money losing companies such as Didi, Aurora, Grab and something called Joby ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3159754/uber-looking-sell-didi-other-non-strategic-stakes-ceo-says](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3159754/uber-looking-sell-didi-other-non-strategic-stakes-ceo-says)).

All of these are now publicly traded, and they're getting shit on as soon as they IPO. It seems like every time these holdings IPO it provides a one time boost to EPS, then the next quarter when the holdings tank, it hurts EPS ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html)).

Didi, Grab and Joby have been trading already, and based on their stock dipping in q4, they should hurt Uber q4 eps, but Aurora IPO'd in November, which I assume would boost eps. Is that how this works? IPO = insta gain? Or was Aurora valuation already privately valued and any gain would be IPO price minus private valuation price?

 Is all of this already priced in? Are puts worth it? I'm also weighing whether Uber becoming semi profitable will make it do a SNAP this week, or if omicron/labor pressures will hurt q1 guidance. Any insight is welcome."

wallstreetbet,"Morning Report | U.S. inflation may continue to soar in January; WuXi Biologics expects 2021 profit attributable to shareholders to increase more than 98% year-over-yearHot News

U.S. inflation likely to continue to soar in January, expected to put pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates

Economic data is expected to show that U.S. inflationary pressures continued to heat up early this year, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.

According to the median forecast of surveyed economists, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) may rise 7.3% year-on-year in January, the largest year-on-year increase since the beginning of 1982. The CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food, is expected to rise 5.9 percent. This follows the release of the government's latest non-farm payrolls report, which showed new momentum in the labor market and accelerating payroll growth, sparking market expectations that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls add 467,000 in January, unexpectedly better than expected

Non-farm payrolls posted the largest increase in three months, with the previous values for November and December revised sharply higher by nearly 710,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4%, still close to market expectations and the lowest since the epidemic of 3.9% set in December. The labor force participation rate was the highest since the epidemic. Hourly earnings rose the most in 20 months year-over-year. Expectations of a hawkish Fed rate hike increase.

Pre-US Credit Week: Investors overwhelmed by interest rate anxiety

As credit markets continue to show signs of stress, borrowers will likely continue to look for a stable window to issue new debt next week, while investors remain picky. The Wall Street syndicate sector is expected to issue about $20 billion in new investment-grade debt. Professionals believe the three issuers that chose not to move forward with deals Thursday will revisit them next week as companies deal with volatility swings.

The sell-off in U.S. bonds and related derivatives has been swift and massive so far this year - uncertainty over monetary policy remains high and risk premiums are likely to widen in the coming weeks. Credit market volatility accelerated last week on Thursday after a poor earnings report unnerved investors at Barclays, then peaked on Friday as a stronger-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report supported the case for a Fed rate hike.

wallstreetbet,"Join me on the OPTIONS 10% challenge...Hey guys. Im the type of person who likes to analyze things and figure out the most efficient way to go about stuff. I love doing TA and solid entry everyday. 

Been thinking alot lately about what ive been doing trade wise and why ive not been as successful as i should be. And really its come down to greedy for me. Alot of you probably read my post over the weekend about not being greedy and how one successful trade a day is all you need. 

I had given a scenario where you could 6x you portfolio in 6 weeks. But that involved risking the whole lot the whole time and that's not smart nor realistic. So it got me thinking... how can i be efficient at this, while successful and minimizing big losses. And this is what i have come up with and what i will be doing starting monday (assuming my funds from fidelity make it to my bank so i can deposit in TOS and they get the options approved. If not we start Tuesday). 

I am calling this the 10% challenge. This challenge will look different for everyone depending on 1. Your risk tolerance 2. You starting capital and 3. How confident you are in your options ability. 

Now this will only work if you are dedicated and consistent. You have to be disciplined in your entry. This is not a FOMO type of trading strategy at all. You have to look for the right entry and the right exit. If your trade stalls out at 7% tou take profits before its -10%!. Profits are king here. Stop losses will be a must if you let these ride which is what i plan to do. 

So heres the strategy and then i will show the math. 

Every week we start fresh. So for me this week im starting with 5k and once i get some funds moved and settled next week will start with 10k. Exact 10k in your account. 
My plan is come friday with whatever profits above 10k i have they will be moved to a separate account and invested in shares of vti. 

So its Monday morning and we have a fresh 10k in our accounts (a fresh 10k we can afford to lose... we never invest what we cant afford to lose). 

What's the plan? Its simple. We are making ONE trade today. ONE good solid trade today that will net us positive gains. How are we going to do that. We are going to use support and resistance along with MOMENTUM. We always trade WITH the momentum NEVER against it. (This post isnt a focus on how to trade options but rather the strategy i can make a separate post on my how to if people want...). 

Okay so we are watching the charts and we have found the good entry. A good entry we know and feel confident in. It goes with the momentum and its NOT right before a new 30 minute candle opens. We will utilize 3-7 dte for these trades for the quickest return. Note- there is high risk if your entry is wrong. If you are still struggling with entries consider doing 14-30 dte. We will also be utilizing the next otm strike (whether thats up or down). 

Now this is the part that EVERYONE including me is going to really struggle with... we are taking profits at 10%. No matter what. We do not let this trade go red. 
This is how i plan to approach this. I will watch my trade as soon as i enter it. If you has a solid entry and good momentum within seconds maybe even minutes you should be at 10-20% up. 

We made a good entry, we are up lets say 10% now. Whats next? We set a stop loss for breakeven. This important! We do not want to see red. We need green or even. We could consider a 5% stop loss here but 5% is tight for options... 

Okay lets say we had a great entry, SPY is on a run, we timed it just how we needed to and we are up 20% within seconds or minute's... we take profits right? Maybe... 

We have 2 things we can do here. 1. We can take profits at 20% and be happy with a killer trade. Or 2. We can set a stop loss for 10% or even 15%. For me if the momentum has stopped and im above 20% im taking profits. If its still running i will do 10% stop and move it up by 5% every 5%. So 25%=15%, 30%=20% etc. 

Okay so we made our one trade of the day. We took profits at 10% like a boss. Now what? Not a damn thing. Go enjoy the rest of your day. 

If everything went right and we followed the 10% rule. Our 10k should have netted 1k profits (i will use round numbers here for the ease of math and reading). 

Okay Tuesday comes our account now has a beautiful 11k in it. What do we do? Same thing. We make ONE GOOD well thought out MOMENTUM trade following the above method. 

So Tuesday we end with $12,100. 

Wednesday comes we use our $12,100 and make ONE GOOD MOMENTUM trade for 10%... now we have $13,310. 

Thursday our $13,310 becomes $14,640 at the end of the day... 

Friday our $14,640 becomes $16,105. 
Congrats you just made 5 easy trades and turned your 10,000 investment into $16,105. You just make $6000 in one week... crazy right? 

NOW this is the important part. We take those 6k in profits and we move into into safer investment like shares of VTI in another account we cant touch. We re-invest our earned money so it continues to work with us. Dont reinvest this is a high risk thing. 

And we start the next monday over with a fresh 10k... 

Now there will be people who say how are you going to perfectly make 5 trades in a row every week without being wrong. Its simple. We are trading momentum. We are trading the trend. We arent guessing. We know when we invest our money and we open our position that its going to go the way we want. We arent concerned at all. And for anyone whos done options for even one day know SPY is volatile yet stable enough to do this. If SPY moves 0.2% thats easily 20-30% gains sometimes. SPY does not need to move much to do this and be successful. The thing about this is we dont have to be perfect... we dont have to be 100% gains right. We have to be right about the momentum. If you cant enter and exit a trade and net 5-10% gains everytime you need to stop what you are doing and find a better method to find entries. 

Okay so some of us still struggle with entries... but i feel most of us easily could get 5% gains every entry.... your 10k using the method above would be at $12,760 at the end of the week. Thats alot of money for barely moving... 

Heres a fun break down (note- this is just doing easy math 5 trades a week for 52 weeks... i know markets not open every monday to Friday but this is just for easy numbers). 
-10k @ 5 trades with 20% take profit= $24,800 on friday... or $770k in one year.
-10k @ 5 trades with 15% profit= $20,113 or $525k one year.
-10k @ 5 trades 10%= $16,105 or $317k/ year
-10k @ 5 trades 5%= $12,762 or 143k/ year 

Now i understand 10k is alot for some people so lets do 5k and 1k for the same thing... 

-5k @ 5 trades 20%= $12,400 or $385k/ year
-5k @ 5 trades 15%= $10,100 or $266k
-5k @ 5 trades 10%= $8,100 or $161k
-5k @ 5 trades 5%= $6,700 or $89k 

-1k @ 5 trades 20%= 78k
-1k @ 5 trades 15%= $52k
-1k @ 5 trades 10%= $31.2k
-1k @ 5 trades 5%= $15.6k 

As you can see there is some absolutely incredible gains to be made when we simplify things. Ive never seen anyone break it down like this and had someone broken it down like this i would never have held the positions ive had while up or made silly yolo trades. Options is a risk. But when we simplify things we can win at this game. 

You have to remove your emotions. We are here for gains and to win and to trade again the next day. I never wanna see anyone post another -99% or another loss porn. I wanna see the accounts that have 15x at the end of the year... cause thats what this strategy allows... 

No ones perfect and we will have bad days. When you have a bad day we stop. We Re-evaluate and try again. If we have a 2nd one maybe we consider paper trading for a bit. Dont get greedy."

wallstreetbet,"Do not bet against Mark ZuckerbergOne bad quarter for Meta and suddenly half the reddit investing community suddenly thinks they are smarter than Mark Zuckerberg.

I am not going to waste time wading into the litany of bear case scenarios that everyone has brilliantly laid out now that the stock has already lost like 40% from ATH. (*Congrats on the post-mortem brilliance. You guys are real fucking geniuses by the way.*) 

In regards to the bear case, let‚Äôs suffice it to say that yeah, Facebook and ol Zuck could have a bad year or two.

But if you were ever going to stop yoloing dailies for a few days and actually take a long term position in your life, you‚Äôd be an absolute smooth brain not to try to scoop up some meta for your retirement.

Instead of puking bullshit about forward P/E, Daily Active Users, revenue per users, time spent in app, and some subjective opinion about whether or not we are going to live with screens on our faces, let‚Äôs just talk about Mark.

My position is pretty simple. **Mark Zuckerberg is a once in a generation CEO and you are simply misinformed if you do not see it**.

Sure he may not come across as the most charismatic Chad out there, and he may not have funny tweets. Perhaps is sense of fashion is shitty. Maybe he does need a better hair cut. And he should probably get some more media training before he testifies in front of congress again.

But the man is a fucking super genius and has a proven track record of being ridiculously competent.

He is literally **on a trajectory to be the most successful human being in the history of American capitalism**.

He isn‚Äôt even middle aged, and he has already achieved as much as - or MORE than - every other billionaire out there.

Let‚Äôs take a moment and compare the ages of some major achievers to Mr. Zuckerberg.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Elon Musk** \- Age 50 - Sold PayPal at 30, started SpaceX at age 31 became CEO of Tesla at age 37
* **Jeff Bezos** \- Age 58 - Founded Amazon.com at age 30
* **Warren Buffett** \- Age 91 - Publicly listed Berkshire Hathaway at age 32
* **Sundar Pichai** \- Age 49 - Hired as CEO of Google at age 42
* **Tim Cook** \- Age 61 - Became CEO of Apple at age 50
* **Steve Jobs** \- Deceased - Invented the iPod at age 46, iPhones at age 52
* **Bill Gates** \- Age 66 - Released Windows 95 and took the PC world by storm at age 41.
* **Jen-Hsun Huang** \- Age 58 - Co-founded Nvidia at age 30
* **Lisa Su** \- Age 52 - Became AMD CEO at age 44.
* **Mark Cuban** \- Age 63 - Sold broadcast.com and became a billionaire at age 40
* **JK Rowling** \- Age 56 - Published Harry Potter at 32
* **Oprah Winfrey** \- Age 68 - Started Oprah Winfrey show at age 32
* **Jamie Dimon** \- Age 65 - Became CEO of JPMorgan Chase at age 52

As you can see, pretty much all of these people didn‚Äôt even start their path to major success until their 30‚Äôs or later.

And I did not just cherry pick old CEO‚Äôs and famous people. This is the story for pretty much everyone who is ultra successful. I mean, look at the dinosaurs who have climbed their way up DC to run America.

I digress.

# Mark Zuckerberg - Age 37 - Founded Facebook at age 20. 1 billion users by age 26. Founded Meta at age 37.

Newsflash fuckwads. Zuckerberg is young enough to be friends with Justin Bieber.

In terms of age, Mark Zuckerberg surpassed the business success of all those other leaders at an age when they were all still going to college parties and trying to get laid.

Today, Zuckerberg is arguably one of the most important people on Earth, his company influences politics and global affairs to an extent that would have given Julius Caesar a 3-day hardon.

Facebook is so big and powerful than American legislators are literally - and rightfully - afraid of it‚Äôs influence on your mind.

And this was NOT an accident. I don‚Äôt care that the idea for his website came from those Winklefucks. Using the internet to have people interact and post photos with people was NOT a unique concept at the time. There were ENDLESS website and communities trying do this very same thing in the early 2000s. I remember, because unlike all you TikTokin zoomers, I was alive and there:

* MSN
* MySpace
* Nexopia
* Friendster
* Hi5
* Second Life
* Photobucket
* Forums
* Chatrooms
* AND MILLIONS OF SHITTY SEGMENTED ONLINE COMMUNITIES MADE IN HTML

But guess what? At the ripe old age of 23, Mark Zuckerberg saw the trend and built Facebook out from basically nothing. *His* website is the one that took over the world, *not* all those others that were trying and had limitless access to capital via the dot com bubble.

He essentially pioneered social media, which is now the dominant cultural medium in our world. 

He did it once, and there's a reasonably good chance he can do it again.

And all these little children in the world have spent the formative years of their childhood LIVING on screens. They will flock to a metaverse when it is developed.

If you look at a comparison in career between Zuck and Musk, **Zuck is pretty much at the life stage where Musk was when he was rich from PayPal and thinking about Tesla and SpaceX**.

All those problems you have identified with AR/VR and iOS privacy and shit? I am sure he will figure it out. He is smarter than all of us, and he's still going to running marathons when Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are admitted to a seniors housing facility.

I am fucking LONG on Mark Zuckerberg, because his career is literally just getting started."

wallstreetbet,"Why the FED is the only thing that matters!I'm here to make sure you don't have a good night of sleep for the next several months. Macro economists like ""David Hunter"" have made bold predictions that we're going to see a parabolic melt up to SPX $6,000 at the end of this bull market run, and I'm here to tell you why that not only won't happen, but that we're about to see SPY, QQQ,  IWM enter a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

First, we need to understand an assumption about the money supply. That is, there is NO money on the ""sidelines""

For example:  If I hold cash in my bank account, that money is lent out to others from the bank which is exchanged for goods and services. That exchange of cash deposited in another's bank account which may then be used to purchase stocks, bonds, etc. The other party receives cash and places it in their bank account. (cycle repeats) 

 If we can assume that all of the money is *fully invested* (see assumption above), then what matters is the *""composition of assets.""*

We see this happen already when money flows from one sector to the next. It can also happen between asset classes, like stocks to bonds or vice-versa. Over the last decade, it has been a free-for-all search for yield. The FED keeping rates near 0.00% has influenced investors to purchase risk assets like equities, trading cards, jpegs, leveraged ETF's, &amp; other dogshit (and sometimes on margin). The point being, cash has been trash, bonds don't provide much % interest, and the only way to grow wealth was to yolo your whole account in meme stocks.

Now that the FED has decided to shut off liquidity and begin rate hikes, there will be a huge shift in the *composition of assets* (not to mention, the money supply stopping/potentially reversing if the FED rolls off their balance sheet = growth in $SPX is gone). Safer assets like bonds/treasuries will have a higher % return with a lower cost of capital than growth stocks. Money will rotate from these risk assets to safer\* assets. It's not a question of ""if"", but a question of ""when"", and with valuations so high, you'd think its probably sooner rather than later? Who wants to be left holding the jpeg bags? 

This process will have a negative impact on the overall equity market, but it will more than likely destroy 0% returning assets, growth stocks, memes, dogshit companies, etc. 

Some may counter this viewpoint with: ""The Economy and company earnings are the best they've ever been!"" to which I would say, if a company is setting record profits today, is it more or less likely to post record profits next quarter?

If you don't believe me yet, think about how $120/bn month was printed since the Covid Crash Bottom and where we are now. Ask yourself, what happens when the FED isn't IN the market propping it up?

tldr;  JPOW is the boogeyman that lives under bull's mattresses. The stock market is not the economy. Gay bears will walk the earth again."

wallstreetbet,"$GOOS ‚Äî Thoughts on upcoming earnings?Canada Goose ($GOOS) stock is usually pretty volatile after earnings, with a pattern of strong directional moves following results and guidance. The stock surged from $37 to $53 during the two weeks that followed the Q3 2021 report, but has since been falling all the way back down to $31. As one can expect, Q4 has historically been the most profitable quarter for the company, driven by an increase in the sale of jackets in preparation for the winter season.

A quick look at Google Trends points to a slightly increased interest over the brand compared to winter 2020, hinting to potentially greater sales: [https://i.imgur.com/t2e6Er5.png](https://i.imgur.com/t2e6Er5.png)

They did raise guidance for the full year 2021 last quarter. I was potentially looking at calls here, but two things do slightly worry me:

* EPS estimate for Q4 2021 remans in my view very high ($1.16), which doesn't leave much room for error. In this market environment, an earnings miss could send the stock sensibly further down
* According to the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), winter 2021/2022 outlook points to ‚Äú*warmer-than-normal temperatures \[...\] across the southern and eastern United States*‚Äù and ‚Äú*colder-than-normal temperatures \[...\] in much of Alaska, and from the Pacific Northwest east into the Dakotas*‚Äù (see the map [here](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/lead01/off01_temp.gif)) ‚Äî a pretty mixed picture, but factoring in the fact that eastern states are the most populated ones, the perspective of a warmer end of season could lead the company to slightly downgrade its guidance for next year

I'm still researching the stock and am probably missing a few more elements. What are you thoughts on upcoming earnings? Do you see $GOOS beating expectations?"

The Russian propaganda machine has won and America doesn't give a shit about Ukraine. Its like that one friend thats so annoying you wish they would leave.
Russia has every reason to make their move now.
-the US doesn't want a war
-Biden looks weak and provides the opportunity 
-they want to show being part of NATO doesn't mean shit
- strengthen their weapons exports when their new equipment wins over US equipment 
-get rid of the fees Ukraine receives from the pipeline

The reports I am reading says 70% of Russia military will be on the border in two weeks. I'm not sure he is going to wait that long..

Trump gave Putin a underhand toss and all he has to do is hit the ball.

Call options are risky. You can lose your entire investment OR 10x your investment in days or less. We all know this.

What if I only spend ¬£10 on each trade? I dont mind losing a measly tenner to make a potential ¬£100. Doesn't this mean I have 10 tries to make ¬£100 to be profitable? This seems so fucking easy.

wallstreetbet,"The catalyst?In the U.S. 900k people have died from COVID. In 2021 an estimated 52% of Americans had life insurance with the average payout being $168k.

52% of 900k at $168k works out to $78.6B in death benefits.

There's been 76.4M COVID cases in the U.S. with a 2.1% hospitalization rate. With an estimated 91.4% of Americans having health insurance all or part of 2020, that works out to approximately 14.6M hospitalization claims.

If the average claim is $30k, that works out to $438B in hospital claims, or $516.6B in claims in the U.S. for deaths and hospital stays.

This all seems to have been priced in during Q1 2020, but insurance companies appear to still be producing earnings as usual, and the market rebounded above pre-covid levels.

How are insurance companies offsetting half a trillion dollars in U.S. death/hospital claims alone on the books?

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) released a report in 2021 titled ""Insurance Linked Securities"". (ILS)

Oh yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like.

https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_insurancelinked_securities.htm

Any of that sound familiar?

In 2019 ILS issuance was at an all time (20 years) high, with Q4 being 50% above the 10 year average. While conveniently close to the start of the pandemic, this may have had more to do with the Affordable Care Act loading insurance company balance sheets with the health care equivalent of sub prime mortgages.

If I read that report right, mortgages had started to find their way into these catastrophe bonds, right as businesses were closing, people were losing their jobs, leases and home loans were at risk of default.

I really hope I'm wrong, but catastrophe bonds being a catalyst for a financial catastrophe would be rather ironic."

We have a raging Inflation and the EZB (European FED) can‚Äòt up the interest rates, because this would instantly bankrupt half of Europe. One example: During the debt crisis 2012, Greece‚Äôs GDP to debt ratio was about 120%. Now it‚Äôs about twice as much (211%) and France is at 98%. So essentially if Lagarde tightens monetary policy (as she should) Italy, Greece and Portugal are on the risk of immediate bankruptcy. Than add the risk of a systemic collapse which would drag Spain and France down and get them to the verge of collapse. Essentially: Either kill of the value of the Euro (6-8% Inflation and it‚Äôs not ‚Äútransitory‚Äù) or risk destroying the EU and kick half of Europe into poverty. The main purpose of the EZB should be price stability, so she would have to raise interest rates to ~7-10% (around the same as expected inflation) but ofc that‚Äôs not possible. One profit idea would be, to buy swiss francs because it profited massively in the last half year. Switzerland in general has way lower inflation rates (~2%).

Yes, yes, I know it's late. But this is a weird situation where MBS prices are front-running a housing market crash. How do we play this? I'm not sure, but I did a little bit of digging and would like to hear others' thoughts.

4 ways to play this in my eyes:

Short MBS / Corporate credit, Short homebuilders, long treasury bills, or short companies with the largest corporate credit / mbs exposure

Not interested in going long t-bills. MBS is below 2008 levels so i'm not sure how much further it'll go, I don't know enough to even begin to predict a floor.

$BAC seems to hold the most exposure to MBB/CMBS/VMBS combined, and also holds the most of LQD.

MBB/CMBS/VMBS = 131,000,000 shares for a total reported value of \~12B.

LQD = 30M shares at $4B. They also have $722M in puts.

They also have a shit ton of puts on other securities so they're probably fairly well setup to minimize losses.

LQD seems to have quite a bit of room to fall, if it too is headed towards '08 levels.

The start-up community has been receptive to the Fund‚Äôs creation and IVY‚Ñ¢ in general, with the volume of pitches exceeding our expectations. Start-ups are unanimous in their praise for the BlackBerry IVY platform‚Äôs unique ability to access and surface harmonized data across multiple vehicle makes and models. Many have remarked that IVY is the silver bullet that they need to win over OEMs. Additionally, the entire automotive investment community has been very welcoming, we‚Äôve forged relationships with the venture arms of OEMs and institutional investors focused on the smart mobility space.
The common refrain from start-ups is that putting software into vehicles is much harder than anticipated. The lack of consistency in accessing sensor data due to multiple vehicle platforms, differences in signal formats, and inertia from complex internal processes continues to validate the value proposition of BlackBerry IVY.

EverWind Fuels to establish a regional green hydrogen hub in Nova Scotia reducing carbon emissions and bringing clean energy jobs to Nova Scotia

Production of green hydrogen to begin in 2025 at former NuStar Storage Terminal in Point Tupper

May 2, 2022

PORT HAWKESBURY, NS ‚Äì EverWind Fuels LLC (‚ÄúEverWind‚Äù), a private developer of green hydrogen and ammonia production, storage facilities and transportation assets, has announced that it has acquired the NuStar storage terminal in Point Tupper, Nova Scotia (‚ÄúPoint Tupper‚Äù). EverWind intends to expand and develop the Point Tupper site to be the location of a regional green hydrogen hub for Eastern Canada, including new green hydrogen and ammonia production facilities. These facilities will create new clean energy jobs, help support Nova Scotia‚Äôs carbon emissions reduction targets, and establish Nova Scotia as a global leader in the production of green hydrogen for domestic and export markets.

‚ÄúAs part of the clean energy transition, we are proud to invest in Nova Scotia and support the province in unlocking the immense opportunity presented by green hydrogen,‚Äù said Trent Vichie, CEO of EverWind Fuels. ‚ÄúThe development of green hydrogen is an essential tool in the fight against climate change. Expansion of the Point Tupper site will support significant economic development in the region that can attract billions of dollars in new investment, create new jobs, and help make Nova Scotia and Canada global leaders in this exciting industry.‚Äù

As an alternative fuel, green hydrogen produced at the site is expected to help provide a green fuel for Nova Scotia and support carbon emissions reduction by over one million tonnes a year by 2025. By 2030, the project could reduce domestic and international carbon emissions by more than four million tonnes a year through the production of green hydrogen.

The Point Tupper site is ideally positioned to produce green hydrogen as early as 2025, supported by significant existing in-place infrastructure. Point Tupper has an existing ice-free, deep-water port with 27-meter depth and two berths which are capable of accommodating the largest vessels in the world. The port is the deepest in Nova Scotia and the surrounding region. In addition, the Point Tupper site has existing rail loading facilities and is adjacent to pipeline networks to support domestic and regional markets. Electricity transmission is available at the site as well as 7.7 million barrels of liquids storage and abundant freshwater, which is adjacent to the site.

The site is operated by a highly qualified, 70-person team trained to protect the surrounding environment and deliver safe operations. In addition, EverWind has engaged a world-class group of partners to support development of the initial phases of the project, including:

Hatch, a global multidisciplinary management, engineering, and development consultancy, is supporting overall engineering design and working with Strum Consulting on the permitting work for the site.
Nel, a global company providing solutions for the production, storage, and distribution of hydrogen is leading detailed engineering for the supply of electrolysers. ‚ÄúWe are excited to be selected for this important and ambitious project‚Äù, says Jon Andr√© L√∏kke, CEO.
KBR, a global science, technology, and engineering company, is supplying the technology for the green ammonia production unit.
In addition, CIBC Capital Markets and Citi are acting as EverWind‚Äôs joint financial advisors. International law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP and Canadian firm McInnes Cooper are acting as EverWind‚Äôs legal counsels.

As part of a staged development, EverWind Fuels also intends to partner with offshore wind developers to further expand production over time, which aligns with the joint announcement by the Canadian and Nova Scotia governments in April 2022 to expand the mandate of Nova Scotia‚Äôs offshore energy regime, to support the transition to a clean economy, and to create sustainable jobs.

‚ÄúOnshore facilities, like Point Tupper, will be key to unlocking this important industry and we are excited to play our part,‚Äù said Vichie. ""We are confident that this is both the right place and the right time to pursue this development,‚Äù said Vichie. ‚ÄúGovernments across Canada are embracing green hydrogen and green ammonia as key parts of Canada‚Äôs clean energy future and, with this investment, we are excited to support the development of a regional hydrogen hub in Eastern Canada.‚Äù

EverWind Fuels is committed to undertake engagement with Indigenous and local communities, governments and local business and planning organizations to ensure feedback is incorporated throughout the development of the project.

‚ÄúWe have been engaging with communities, businesses and local organisations, and governments at every level early on in this project because we know it is a critical part of the process,‚Äù said Vichie. ‚ÄúWe are working with Indigenous-owned consulting firms to ensure our engagement with Mi‚Äôkmaq communities and organizations is done thoughtfully and in the spirit of listening. This engagement and consultation activities will increase in the coming months.‚Äù

https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-beats-revenue-estimates-record-deliveries-2022-04-20/

Analysts dropped delivery and revenue forecasts on the run-in, so Tesla as usual, best expectations - seriously one wonders what these analysts are looking at when it came to revenues and costs.  At 310K deliveries in 1Q, Musk's call of 1.5 million deliveries for 2022 was a stretch, after flat deliveries in 1Q from 309K in 4Q.  

Shanghai production has been halted for a month now.  Whilst Xpeng has not been, it and other Chinese automakers have been seriously effected by lock downs:

https://m.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nio-xpeng-li-auto-deliveries-hit-by-lockdownrelated-supply-chain-issues-2815177%3fampMode=1

Tesla investors have been a little too distracted by Twitter lately.  The underlying business is not going to hit 1.5m deliveries.  It may even struggle for 50% delivery growth given China.  Xpeng, Nio and Li were all expanding deliveries far faster and have been hit big time by the lockdown.  

The Tesla share price, as usual seems to be missing reality, in this case of serious Chinese production shortcomings, that no fledgling German factory is going to replace."

wallstreetbet,"Deep ITM Covered Calls on ZIMWith a stock like ZIM or really any stock in a cyclical sector where the the stock is at a heightened state due to macroeconomic factors that cause the stock to payout a high dividend, what are the drawbacks to selling a deep itm covered call LEAP? The way I see it, as long as you put the strike low enough that the stock doesn't fall beneath it, you basically break even on buying and selling the stock and collecting premium, and then you just get to collect the dividends.

Essentially what I am asking is wouldn't selling a deep itm call protect you from the downside risk of stock dropping once the macroeconomic factors end while still allowing you to collect the dividend. Am I missing something obvious?"

wallstreetbet,"The market went back up today! We are headed back to the bull run, boys. Seriously, look at this chart. Nothing could possibly go wrong.Typically, throughout history, when the market indices have quadrupled in the last decade, and doubled in the last two years, it is the sign of a stable bull market that lasts for years to come.

I can think of a number of precedents in history when the peak of a sustained parabolic trend is followed by a dip and a lower peak before dropping back down again, the market rebounds and provides investors with steady gains all the way through retirement.

Look at this chart:  You can see that the market is really, really stable right now.  It just keeps going up.  Where as in past decades it went up and then back down again, this time, it just went up 4 times as much, and didn't go back down at all.  That is exactly why I believe it will keep going up, and by the end of the year, we will all be very rich.

Furthermore, Elon Musk, leader of the most profitable car company in the world, just sent out a tweet telling his shareholders never to sell a stock they believe in.  Right after he sold $8.5 billion dollars worth of his own company.

See the chart below:  This is what we in Finance refer to as a ""reverse camel toe"" or a ""sleeping giant formation.""  See back in 2020, everyone thought this was the end of the bull market, and there was going to be a recession.  But actually, that was just a little hit, just the push that the American economy needed to *unlock its potential*.

After that, the index skyrocketed.  I think that's exactly what is happening right now.  There is even more potential to be unlocked, and I am taking off my shorts and elongating my longs

wallstreetbet,"SILVER RAID MAY 15TH!SILVER RAID MAY 15TH!!

If the price of silver were based directly on the real physical silver market, silver‚Äôs price should be at $5,000 an ounce. I‚Äôm not saying the price of silver will reach $5,000 an ounce; I‚Äôm just saying that the actual PHYSICAL silver spot price is not only extremely undervalued, but that it is an illusion compared to the real value of an ounce of physical silver, since it is totally disconnected from reality. [Let me explain further.]
as originally entitled The Paper Silver Market is 250 Times the Size of the Physical Silver Market.
‚Ä¶[A price of $5,000] may seem totally crazy, but who can pretend knowing exactly how an ounce of silver is worth, after decades of manipulation and turning real investors‚Äô demand from the physical market to the paper one, and years of exponential monetary printing by all the planet‚Äôs central banks?@Gold&amp;Silver
The Physical vs. Paper Market Difference
The actual spot price for silver has no real value and is not legitimate when we seriously compare the real physical silver market to the paper market and its myriad of financial derivatives.
[According to an] article by Bloomberg, which has always been a reliable source with their published data, the size of the global annual silver market is equal to $5 trillion‚Ä¶
[According to a recent interview with] David Morgan‚Ä¶the annual physical silver production is roughly one billion ounces.
With silver trading around $20 currently, this represents a $20 billion market for physical silver so the size of the physical silver market is of $20 billion.
[The difference between the $5 trillion &amp; the $20 billion number is that]‚Ä¶ Bloomberg‚Äôs $5 trillion number represent the entirety of the paper silver market, including all paper financial products (certificates, options, ETFs etc.) derived from the real physical market‚Ä¶[that allows] investors to be exposed to silver.
The 250:1 Leverage
[The above discrepancy]‚Ä¶makes for a 250 to 1 ratio between the paper market and the physical silver market‚Ä¶meaning that, for every ounce of physical silver, there are 250 ounces of paper silver circulating in several financial products. In other words, only one contract or certificate issued out of 250 could be convertible into physical silver‚Ä¶[that is,] the silver market is being leveraged 250 to 1.
(The multiplication of those financial products on silver has skirted investors‚Äô demand from the real physical market, thus creating a virtual silver supply without putting any pressure on the physical silver market. A roundabout way of keeping the price low.)
If now, as the regulation agencies are claiming, the goal is to create a new fixing for silver that would better reflect the physical market (notably from pressure coming from countries, like China, wishing to have their say in the fixing of precious metals prices), the leverage between paper silver and physical silver is at risk of radically evolving.
Let‚Äôs hypothesize what the silver price would be directly based on the physical silver market:
Today, the actual size of the silver market is, according to Bloomberg, of $5 trillion.
$5 trillion divided by 20 billion (physical market) = 250
250 X $20 (silver spot price) = $5,000 an ounce
Conclusion
Every investor holding silver in the form of financial products, without the possibility of verifying the physical existence of their investment, should ask the question as to what will happen when more holders of said products will ask for physical delivery. (In reality, we already know what will happen, because one of the large banks from the Netherlands, ABN-AMRO, already defaulted, a little more than a year ago, on its gold  certificates by settling customers in cash.)

GOOG is set to split at the close of business July 15th

AMZN is set to split at the close of business July 3rd 

At the current prices, GOOG would split to 117.15 per share and AMZN would split to 124.50. 

As long term holds, these prices look pretty attractive in my opinion. NFA. The amount of volume these stocks will trade at post split will be very interesting.

Well apparently May just might bring the rally‚Ä¶ That was a hell of a rally we just saw today. And I gotta say that ones gonna be in the memory bank for quite a long time. I don‚Äôt think ive ever seen SPY rally 2.38% in less than 1.5 hours like that. Absolutely nuts. I swear every Monday has some wild reversal like this lately. I definitely looking at the overall trend and volume today would not have guess we woulda finished green on the day. But here we are finishing up 0.6% at 414.48.

As you can see SPY is still in an overall downward channel right now. However, we are only about $3 from breaking the resistance line from the major downward channel we have been in. It will be interesting to see if that is broken and we rally the rest of the week or not. 

Current support now lies at 403 with extreme support down near 390 IF things start ramping up bear style again. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n7b71facl5x81.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c4cffaa7e10fa6ede8642c95e66166b18891d9b

As I had mentioned on Friday the VIX daily chart our happy spot is 28 to 33.5 which is right where we closed within today. It appeared early one that 32.32 was going to be the top of the range but by end of day we were hitting highs of 37.58. 

The VIX has not been this high since March 8th and SPY has not seen the 405 low since May 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vom8rqzcl5x81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c3d4079a48cf683f8f2d674dd2a26d5cfd36e74

During this mornings pre market I called out 405 as the next support for SPY and we hit off it within 0.02 cents. Right now we are still within that massive red downward channel overall. Tomorrow 418 will be resistnace to break the current downward trend line which is also the next resistance level. 

Support will remain down near 403 as the most extreme. 

Major support levels- 410 √† 405  
 Major resitance levels- 415 √† 420 √† 422.5 

I am pretty conflicted now on where spy is headed. Before power hour I worked under the impressive that what ever trend today had assuming it was strong would have been inversed the following day especially if we got a very bearish 400-405 finish. This finish today and the end of day rally has me thinking two things. 1. Much like in January when we flash crashed to 410 the market hit capitulation and finally BTFD (bought the fucking dip) along with the VIX high over 36 for first time in two months the fear finally peaked. Or 2. There was some sort of leak of FOMC and markets rallied based off that. The third scenario is based off two and makes me think we are going to rally into FOMC and dump like never before (think top 5 type of red days) once the fed fucks it all up. 

Today is either going to turn out to be the worlds most massive bull or bear trap. 

Days like today are why I love day trading over swing trading. I don‚Äôt gotta be right for 24 hours. I just gotta be right in that moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple too saw quite the red day that turned into a bullish day seeing a bounce off its lower channel support of 153 today for the yellow bear channel. Apple also finished right under its key resistance of the daily 200ema at 158.16.

I mentioned last week that Apple rarely has more than two candles in a row under the daily 200 ema so it will be interesting if we were to rally from here on out and hold above the daily 200ema. 

Support tomorrow for apple is 152 with resistance at the daily 200ema of 158 √† daily 8ema at 160.59 followed by upper channel resistance at 165 (unlimited upside).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l97of5nel5x81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7b5190414f74f0e4048d786ab7dee6cef4be36c

QQQ saw a nice recovery along with Apple and SPY of course. Today they made a new lower low reaching that 310 support level I had mentioned on Friday. 

With 310 now being support QQQ will look for resistance at 319 √† 322.5 (daily 8ema) √† 328.21 and support at 318 √† 310.

Overall QQQ downward channel is much milder much like Apples compared to SPYs which is quite aggressive. 

Overall knowing this is FOMC meeting and literally anything can happen im trying to stay unbiased. Right now I see some bullish momentum being carried into the day tomorrow but I honestly would not be surprised tomorrow to see a bullish day putting us up near that daily 8ema at 422 only to fall short EOD and finish the week essentially flat leading into FOMC. The markets true sentiment will be known Wednesday though. And of course once 230 hits everyone better hang onto their hats! 

10% challenge-

Today was one of those days for me where I felt like I couldn‚Äôt do my normal strategy of get in hold and ride the 8ema wave down. Almost every candles especially watching the bullish/ bearish volume had some sort of fake out on it. I ended up resulting in 0dte scalps for most of the day and hit my highest number of trades ever in a day at 24. 

Despite my daily profits p/l going up and down a lot I ended up finishing at 1.5x daily profit goal which I am very happy with. That power hour reversal burnt me to a crisp and I had to salvage the day with scalps.

\- I averaged down my 441 59dte calls at 410 today but missed my opportunity at 405 to average down or those would be green but im okay with that.   
 \- I also held my now 4dte 432C lottos all day and EOD averaged them down. 

I am pretty confident by EOW I will see those 432C and 441c green.

wallstreetbet,"Plug Power and the hydrogen revolutionI was surprised at the end of last week when in the chats premarket someone said H2 is scam. I really invite you guys to do your own DD, hydrogen is the only way we don't go extinct. There are multiple reasons why we can't rely in batteries, hydrogen is a much better form of energy storage and it will substitute first diesel and finally gasoline. The time to invest is now. This is from today's SEC filling: Form DEF 14A - filed by Plug Power Inc‚Äù  


‚ÄúThe Company‚Äôs three year goal is to achieve a stock price of $100/share (or more) by 2024 and the price-vesting hurdles are intended to drive that performance. To achieve this goal, our CEO and the management team would have to more than triple Plug Power‚Äôs market cap to grow Plug Power to an almost $60 billion company over the next three-year period"""

&gt;  AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (""AST SpaceMobile"") (NASDAQ: ASTS), the company building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network designed to be accessible directly by standard mobile phones, today announced it has received an experimental license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) supporting its U.S.-based testing of the BlueWalker 3 satellite.
&gt; 
&gt; The license covers BlueWalker 3 space-to-ground testing in the United States using 3GPP low-band cellular frequencies and Q/V-band frequencies, subject to certain restrictions.
&gt; 
&gt; The authorization comes as the company prepares for the planned summer 2022 launch of BlueWalker 3, its test satellite with an aperture of 693 square feet that is designed to communicate directly with cell phones via 3GPP standard frequencies.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúWe appreciate the diligent support of the FCC in providing the experimental license for our upcoming satellite launch,‚Äù said AST SpaceMobile Founder, Chairman and CEO Abel Avellan. ‚ÄúTogether with other testing around the world, this license will enable us to conduct some of our most important testing here, at home, in the United States.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; AST SpaceMobile continues to pursue additional authorizations with the FCC related to its planned constellation of BlueBird satellites.
&gt; 
&gt; AST SpaceMobile's mission is to eliminate the connectivity gaps faced by today's five billion mobile subscribers moving in and out of coverage zones, and bring cellular broadband to approximately half of the world's population who remain unconnected. Partners in this effort are leading global wireless infrastructure companies, including Rakuten Mobile, Vodafone and American Tower.


I thought the few space apes that weren't wiped out during the past year might appreciate an update for ASTS. Now that they can freely test their upcoming test satellite this summer, it's looking more and more likely that the company will be able to deliver on their promise of providing 5G anywhere on the planet.

Needless to say when they start offering service by next year/2024 shit will be printing money. Will add more on the next dip, NFA.

wallstreetbet,"A little bit ago I asked about some stupid idea I had and here‚Äôs an update. (Original post &amp; updated info)Okay hear me out, just wanna know the legality of this thought I have is.

td Ameritrade allows immediate use of funds up to 4 days before fully cleared. At the same time they allow up to 250,000$ to be deposited a day. Now if you try and make a deposit that you don‚Äôt have the capital to back. Td will either warn you giving you a day or two to fund the account accordingly or put you on margin call forcing you to liquidate ur securities until the funds are straightened out. So hear where my questions come in. Let‚Äôs say you set up a deposit for 200,000k and use it to buy x amount of a particular stock, this stock jumps idk 10% you sell for profit while on margin. Now in the following days the deposit never clears, and you‚Äôre left to give back the ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù money but the action of buying and selling has been recorded, profits have been taken. so does the buyer/seller keep the profits or would you be forced to forfeit that as well? Is this even a legal thing to do?

Edit: YOOO UPDATE!!!! So I did it with 10,000$ out of a side account I use for bills and purchased 1,597 shares of RDBX @6.27 then sold @9.10$ for 14,536. So I‚Äôll update further if they decide to suspend my account and take my profits. But as of right now It only says my margin balance is the 10,000 and the 4,500 is in my account balance as usable cash."

1. Beijing has announced they will not delist Nio meaning the concerns that help push it down 50% are no longer valid
2. Huge expansion- they have spent the last year rapidly growing and expanding into various markets around the world
III. They are about to sign a deal with BYD. These companies partnering is going go to produce insane products.
4. Tech is about to rebound going into earnings. China is about to rebound with big money moving back in. Both these things will push Nio higher
E. Their vehicles are beautiful

wallstreetbet,"The Wall St MentalityIf algos treat GME and AMC the same, that demonstrates where Wall St's head is at. AMC's enterprise value is more than 2.5x GME, but GME has way better prospects and financial health. Wall St is wrong on GME again because they're not hedged appropriately for its long term business potential. They think the groupthink of apes is a bigger factor behind what moves GME from the this point forward as though the market is just influenced by human behavior rather than business building or destruction. They ignore the biggest factor behind the greatest short squeeze in history: Ryan Cohen.

This is not about a squeeze to infinity, but there's real potential for this thing to compound like Tesla from here. Consider that the gaming and metaverse industries grow faster and have more margin/cash flow potential than autos, insurance, or renewables. Ryan Cohen is not just rejuvenating a retailer. He's building a tech giant. He's poaching from tech giants. He achieved the balance sheet ratios of a tech giant during the squeezes. He has the strategic vision, focus, skin in the game, and conservative financial approach of a tech giant founder. Current tech giants have physical footprints the same size as GameStop or larger. 

Power comes from strategic position. GameStop is not in a powerful position, but Ryan took on this project because he saw the necessary elements and a path to achieve a powerful position. Since then he's been working his ass off for shareholders with this as his sole focus. You didn't see much tangible progress, because the first year was the secretive, big-picture stage. He has promised the market nothing and he will easily over deliver this year. None of this is new information, but it is missing from any Wall St take on GME. They're too busy laughing at apes a year later.

TL;DR: I like the stock."

Someone recently posted about getting into shippers. Although I‚Äôm still scarred by the OG $DRYS squeeze, the industry looks quite attractive at these levels. 

Currently down due to lower demand (presumably omicron played a significant role in putting a pause on import/exports), the BDI as a whole is sitting at a pretty attractive level. If you bring the chart out to 5 years, you‚Äôll see that ~2100 was previously a resistance point multiple times.

wallstreetbet,"SAVA TO A 1000 AND THIS IS WHYGood news today: the FDA still has NOT halted the P3 trials. And neither they will do so tomorrow or the day after.

Don‚Äôt forget: it is true that the FDA usually has 150 - 180 days for providing a FORMAL response to Citizen Petitions. However, having worked for the European Medicine Agency (and a national drug authority in a European Member State) I want to give you some insight, how such petitions are processed.

First and most important: such request, even though they have been often abused to disturb competitors, the content of a CP could concern the safety of patients who are taking this drug after authorisation, but also before authorisation. The important thing is ‚Äûsafety‚Äú here. 

After the formal check whether it is permissible and acceptance of the petition, there is quick first scientific assessment whether there is imminent danger/risk for patients/consumer. If the outcome is there, that that may be the case, more resources if needed are given to that CP and the CP gets higher priority. 

Then there is a dynamic process, which is driven by the data and evidence in the CP, soon it becomes more clear how likely it is that indeed patients are at risk and then the following decision is made, already within a month the latest:

1.) imminent danger: FDA must act quickly 

2) no imminent danger: FDA can make use of the maximum time given to respond to a CP. Whether the FDA indeed will need the maximum time depends on practical things: workload of the respective unit/department and priorities. The time is then used to prepare a draft statement which undergoes internal review (both, scientific and by their legal service). 

The point is the following and is great for SAVA longs and why I added again yesterday 400 shares:

1) the FDA has done long ago their initial assessment and the outcome must have been: the patients in the P3 trials are not at risk.

2) point 2 is evidenced by the fact the FDA did not halt the trials. If there was an imminent safety issue, clinicaltrials.gov is updated quickly (otherwise indeed they are often behind) and study centers must be I formed to stop recruitment. The process recruitment includes enrollment of suitable patient who were found eligible after screening and checking incision and exclusion criteria. A patient enrolled in such a trial gets dosing within 1-2 days after enrollment. This study center must be informed to halt recruitment IF there was a safety concern by the FDA. We can exclude that this has happened.

3) remember: if the CP has merits and patients could be at risk, the FDA cannot wait until day 150 or even 180. Today we have day 115. That tells me with a very high degree of certainty that the FDA has no concerns and that the CP will be dismissed. The longer it takes, the less uncertainty. No way the FDA would make use of 150 days or more if they had seen that the results were manipulated and consequently patients could be at risk as argued by the petitioner.

For us that means: the longer it takes, the more we can relax. But it also means: the more nervous the shorts will become when we are approaching the time the FDA could come up with their response to the CP. We are approaching this time, and that is the reason for all the shorts activity, Twitter attacks, supplements to the CP etc‚Ä¶.

I took advantage of these considerations and I added several times now when we are approaching the low 40s. I will do so in January again, if the FDA has not responded by Christmas. Latest in early 2022 the stock price will rise sharply even before the FDA comes out with their statement, because the shorts know of course the truth behind their CP (of course only the big shorts behind the CP, not necessarily the small retailer shorts). So, relax the few remaining trading days in 2022 !"

wallstreetbet,"Minsheng Bank Exposure to Evergrande Debt Could Collapse Chinese Banks and Trigger MOASS**TLDR:** The first of many Chinese Banks could be about to fail and this could trigger MOASS.  If Chinese financial instruments are being used by US hedge funds as collateral for highly leveraged shorts in...say...our favorite video game or theater stocks...then the collapse of the Chinese banking system could trigger our much anticipated margin calls.  Considering that the data coming out of China is total horseshit, things could be even worse than they appear in this report.

Link to video on Minsheng Bank here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ud-FETmvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ud-FETmvM)

A report in Bloomberg dated January 11th, based on a Citigroup report from September of 2021 paints a messy picture for China Minsheng Bank.  According to the report, the bank holds at least $20 Billion of high-risk developer debt including that of Evergrande.  This represents 27% of Tier 1 Capital held by the bank.  

Link to Bloomberg Report:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/world-s-worst-performing-bank-lent-billions-to-china-evergrande](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/world-s-worst-performing-bank-lent-billions-to-china-evergrande)

However, things could be much worse for the following reasons:

1. The report is dated September 2021 and is likely based on data from August.  What was considered a low-risk developer in August is almost certainly considered high risk now.  Take Shimao for example.  Just a month ago Shimao had an investment-grade credit rating from Fitch, but today they are on the brink of collapse. So the amount of high-risk debt held by Minsheng has almost certainly increased significantly.
2. The amount of Tier 1 Capital held by Minsheng bank could be a total BS figure. The bank has a history of shady dealings (put a pin in that, we'll circle back) and we've already seen that the data coming out of China can't be trusted.  Think I'm kidding? Consider this...Evergrande has never once reported a quarterly loss.  $300 billion in debt.  No sales. And yet somehow they have always been profitable?  The numbers coming out of china are dogshit!
3. There is no way of knowing just how much off-balance sheet Wealth Management Product Debt Minsheng bank is carrying.  A note issued by Fitch back in August of 2021 estimated that WMP debt at Minsheng amounted to 22% of deposits. Link to Fitch note from August 2021:  [https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/fitch-affirms-minsheng-bank-long-term-idr-at-bb-outlook-stable-31-08-2021](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/fitch-affirms-minsheng-bank-long-term-idr-at-bb-outlook-stable-31-08-2021)

Now consider that Minsheng Bank has a history of abusing China's shadow banking system via off-balance sheet debts known as ""Wealth Management Products.""  These are basically unregulated, secret debt securities that promise ungodly returns that are pawned off on unsuspecting investors as risk-free debt instruments when they're really hot garbage.  Back in 2017, the company was fined and several of it's managers were arrested for defrauding investors of some $440 Million (US) by selling Wealth Management Products that didn't actually exist.  At the time it was estimated that China had some $4 trillion (US) in shadow bank debt.  Today those estimates range from $8-$11 trillion (US).  Since these products don't get reported on bank balance sheets, there is no way to know how much of it is out there!

Link to 2017 Article on Minsheng's Wealth Management Scandal: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/china-minsheng-shadow-banking.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/china-minsheng-shadow-banking.html)

&amp;#x200B;

If things at Minsheng are as bad as I think they are, then the bank is already on the brink of collapse.  And when you factor in counter-party risk and contagion possibility, the entire Chinese Banking system could be on the brink.  If that happens, we may find out very soon that shady outfits such as Shitadel have been holding this dogshit debt as collateral on their books and it could trigger enough margin calls to launch MOASS.

News and Fed scaring people out of the market who have paper hand and follow their advice as gospel. Mark my words. What if we have only three rate hikes in 2022 or what if we even have only two rate hikes? The market will boom before the end of the year when they decide not to raise rates for one of those already dot plotted moments in time the market is already prepared for

I‚Äôm calling over 10% gain in the S&amp;P 500 for 2022 and we are currently down for the year. This buying opportunity is actually just as good if not better than the original Covid hit in my opinion in growth stonks. Some people are going to make bank.

If you tards have any gay bear friends, please teach them how to buy put options and tell them to put their money where their mouth is and short these markets. Teach them how to short individual growth stocks that are already down 50% and 70% and make them buy the puts. Give them the tickers of the losers, give them tutoring on how to start an options brokerage account, nurse them into buying puts based on their own convictions. Fortune favors the convincing tard.

IMO - This is a very dangerous market for bears. The bulls have already been severely wounded - backing the truck up. Buying the dip, selling puts, buying puts in the VIX‚Ä¶ 

Let‚Äôs go - this is the moment Diamond hands in indebted growth companies shine. 

About 40% of stocks on the Nasdaq exchange have lost 50% or more off their highs. About 2/3 of NASDAQ stocks down 20% (bear market)

NASDAQ quietly got shredded already and mainstream really did not even notice. Public does not even know the pain.

wallstreetbet,"I have this crazy feeling that China is lying to us. By not telling the truthSo China's  ridiculous one child policy started in  1980 and average age of a parent in China is 30(I think).
This means the effect of the time bomb they created will be felt right about now, when the majority of the young parents are born after 1980. Now I know everyone's following Chinese real estate giants like Evergrande and Kaisa brought to it's knees, but this is only a symptom of the problem. The real problem here is there probably aren't enough people to buy the properties. And many will probably inherit homes from their parents. Means the popped bubble in its housing market cannot be handled as a bail-out or ""restructuring"" will just transfer the mess and become a bigger problem. 

From South China Morning Post:
""China had just 12 million babies last year, down from 14.65 million in 2019, marking an 18 per cent decline year on year""
I don't think many understand the significance here. The population problem can't be solved with a snap of a finger. Simply lifting the one child policy isn't enough.

In my view the real indicator of any country's young population is the no. of smartphone sales, which started tanking in Q1 of 2019 itself in [China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/220988/global-smartphone-market-share-by-country/).

I don't think any of the models in the world predict a completely chaotic China. Automation and other solutions can only get you so much. You need young people for an economy to be booming especially one like China which up until now grew on the back of cheap labour and workforce availability. Despite what people think the CCP [can't](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2800PN) walk over the people. Policy changes won't be easy. I see no way out for a decent period of time. Could be a lot more chaos than what anybody is expecting especially when we know  that most of the data they are sharing are most certainly bogus."

wallstreetbet,"OnlyFans will be the #1 Meme Stonk of 2022Day 52 since the OnlyFans Axios article broke.

My boner is bruised. My hopes are bare. But what keeps me alive is the meme-ory of OF becoming the first public pussy slanging company listed on the NASDICK.

The simplords on this sub will shove their YOLOs so far down the Assk, the green dildos will be of hulkstoric proportions.

The window to enter will be minimal. As soon as a deal is reached with whatever medium they decide to go public (if they go public at all for that matter), the limp dick simps, including myself, will open the floodgates and the memes will flow like a heavyset period from a thot who‚Äôs OnlyFans is dedicated to the kink.

But OnlyFans value isn‚Äôt entirely in its ability to become the #1 meme of 2022. The company‚Äôs fundamentals are any rational investor's wet dream. Revenues are impressive and consistent. Some would even argue that their business model would be the first of its kind, PaaS (Porn as a Service) due to their subscription-based model. Investors love SaaS because it eliminates a high degree of uncertainty. Knowing how much money is coming in, give or take a margin of error or historic volatility, breeds confidence in a company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern. Did I mention? OnlyFans internal forecasts has the company growing to over $12 billion in gross merchandise value (meaning how much money is being exchanged on the platform annually) with a revenue cut of $2.5 billion by the end of 2022. That is healthier than a pair of tits in your face right when you wake up.

BUT WAIT. Surely large investors are worried about their reputation and investing is not a good look for them or their firms‚Ä¶

Do you really think these guys have that kind of concern to keep their ‚Äòmorals‚Äô on the right side of the business? FUCK NO. If they did, they wouldn‚Äôt be investing in Lockheed Martin. If they did they would have pulled out of Apple as soon as they found out their iPhone manufacturers were building nets on top of their buildings to prevent suicide jumpers. They would have taken the Nike shoes right off their feet once they were aware they were likely made by child slave labor. You gotta understand that at a certain level of opportunity to make money, morals mostly go out the window and they aren‚Äôt going to build any nets lower than the roof.

This is why an OnlyFans IPO has power. Money. It‚Äôs too big to ignore. And it gets amplified by the fact that OF will likely be valued like a SaaS company, which has the highest revenue multiples of any industry.

Don‚Äôt be asleep at the keyboard. Join me in furiously masturbating in anticipation of a news drop about OnlyFans. Spread the word like the thots spread the lips. And when the day comes, all I ask for is a reach around.

This IPO is long overdue, like a girl's period after an unprotected drunk fuck. OnlyFans has been trying to go public with their pubics for quite some time. The pent-up anticipation is soon to explode. Don‚Äôt miss it, you fucking cucks.

Oh by the way, there are some rumors. Do some research. You might be able to get your dick wet before everyone else. Ain‚Äôt saying more."

Buy short-dated ATM straddles (more risky), buy puts, directly short the S&amp;P 500 (less risky), or stay in cash (not really risky at all) (see ""How to position yourself"").

&gt; *SINK RATE! SINK RATE!*

\- Boeing 787 MAX TAWS, being piloted by Captain Powell

---

Let's talk about options! The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) has the most liquid options market in probably the world. Now sometimes people, instead of using these derivatives for gambling based on what side of a yard a dog poops on, use them to hedge their exposures to stocks and the market. 

They are bought and sold by market makers (Citadel's the king, obviously, but there are others). People (in general) buy put options and sell call options. Sometimes though, there are speculators who would buy call options and sell put options (think WSB, thetagang, your grandfather's pension, etc).

Market makers want to do one thing: capture the spread between the bid and the ask price. They don't care about short ladders or whatever. They'll happily be long or short SPX, GME^[1], TSLA, whatever if it makes them more money.

In order to hedge their exposure to the movement of stock price action (gamma), volatility (vanna), and time (charm), they buy and sell /ES (S&amp;P futures) to hedge to their delta^[2].

If dealers are negatively exposed to *gamma*, things get a bit volatile but if dealers get negatively exposed to *vanna*, things get real volatile real fast because they are selling into selling (which increases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) and buying into buying (which decreases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) in order to hedge.

To explain with a simple analogy: that crazy ex, she's vanna. Vanna will take you to your highest highs but will also take you to your lowest lows. And... yeah those lows will be low. And no, I'm not going to help you ""get over"" her. And by the way, my bf is coming over for the week so we'll need the house.

Back to options.

It's worth noting that dealers quote their options in *volatility* terms, not dollars and cents^[3]. But implied volatility is relatively low for a 1000 point drop right now and [*isn't increasing as we drop*](https://i.imgur.com/ct8TGaJ.png).

This is because there are a lot of people systematically selling puts, driving down IV. And because IV is being driven down by the put sellers, bulls can't get a sustained bear market rally (since these rallies are often fueled by rehedging)

But it's pretty obvious to anyone who's traded that realized volatility has far outstripped implied volatility (especially on the ""FDs"") and that FDs are relatively cheap. VIX is 29 right now, which implies about a 2%ish (off the top of my head) move each day. We're getting multi percent intraday moves, even if close-to-close we're going relatively slow. *This is absurd.*

I could go on but you get the point already so let's move on.

# How to position yourself

So... there are a couple ways you can play this relatively historic event depending on your risk tolerance (from most risky to least risky)

1. **Buy straddles extremely close to expiration, especially on days with large intraday moves.** Because IV is chronically underpriced here, you should be able to make money buying 0 DTE straddles. Don't use Robinhood or anything like that, they'll screw you over by market selling your position early. Also don't do it systematically, because you will lose out when you don't get the move you want.
2. **Buy somewhat longer term put options.** SPX 6/21 3800p (SPY 6/21 380p) is probably a decent option and has a decent chance of going ITM. You can sell on a volatility spike or keep them going into expiration.
3. **Keep hitting those tails.** 3œÉ 30 DTE SPY put options (it's currently SPY 6/21 305p) are only 13bps ($0.50). On a massive move, those tails will explode in value. You're not going for them going ITM, you're going for P/L so you can unload your bags onto Citadel. Buy them when VIX is in the 20s.
4. **Short E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures (/ES or /MES) or SPY or something.** This will be probably the least gut wrenching thing to do. You'll make a lot of money, but you probably won't get a heart attack in 20 years from the stress of watching options change rapidly in value. So... it has its downsides. Wait for a large volatility blow up (look at VIX) or for Fed to reverse course to unload your position.
5. **Go cashgang.** Sure you'll miss out on gains, but you'll only decay at 8%/year vs. the 30%+ drop (+ decaying at 8%/year). You can [place $10k into I-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) if you're worried about inflation at an interest rate of 9.62% *risk-free*.

(My positions are #4 and a bit of #3 opportunistically.)

Good luck WSB, you're gonna need it.

# Some anticipated criticism
**But volatility is heteroskedastic!**
Your criticism here is basically that IV doesn't move 1-to-1 with SPX and while that's true, realized volatility is still above implied volatility (VIX should be like in the 40s). But implied volatility is still implying that there isn't hedging and a deeper analysis reveals that in general, there are a lot of put sellers.

There's also a pretty well established inverse correlation in SPX with IV in general (although don't naively apply this to single stocks, especially ones like GME). 

**But volatility should be low for a sustained drop!**

Sure but volatility isn't constant and is based on a few things including how """"""fearful"""""" the market is. And even so, even if we sustained a constant move down every single day (which we don't) you'd still have gamma P/L to contend with. This alone makes it so that volatility is 0 or whatever but it's also dependent on other factors here. What I'm contending here is that these factors are such that volatility is massive underpriced, especially with the massive intraday moves that we are seeing.

**VIX is a bad volatility index!**

Yeah I know but I used it for simplicity. Anyone in the vol space knows that SPX vol and skew (not the SKEW index!) isn't being bid up all that much relatively so... yeah.

# Footnotes
1. Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options. MMs got caught offsides a bit by the January 2021 event (basically the options chain acted as if every option was 50Œî) and the gamma profile was very negative then, as anyone who works on a desk will tell you (this is what the SEC got wrong in their report). It's an interesting happening, but it's a story for another time.

2. Plus some to account for skew. Also, it's worth noting that delta-hedging exists independent of BSM. You still have to hedge for price movements, volatility, and time even if you aren't pricing your options using BSM, which practitioners don't.

3. Remember that everything except for volatility and rates are known observables so these are the only two things that can really be ""priced"" per se. Something like BSM can be used to map IVs to dollars and cents.

wallstreetbet,"Info about monkeypoxInitial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headaches, muscle ache, swelling and backpain.

Patients typically develop a rash one to three days after the appearance of fever, often beginning on the face and spreading to other parts of the body, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

The rash, which can cause severe itching, then goes through several stages before the legions scab and fall off.

The infection typically lasts two to four weeks and usually clears up on its own.

Monkeypox cases can occasionally be more severe, with some deaths having been reported in West Africa.

However, health authorities stress that we are not on the brink of a serious outbreak and the risks to the general public remain very low.

""While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasize it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person,"" Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said Saturday."

Luna is absorbed by UST to buy b.tc when b.tc is in a sell off and sell B.tc when the price is high, returning the funds to Luna. Only catch(s) are, timing, B.tc value, and most importantly trading volume.

When volume is stagnant, the system bleeds down until there is stimulation likely from LFG.

This system worked beautifully during the immense trading volume it saw during its demise. Lately, trading volume has died due to overall fear of the market and the sketchy skit Mr. Do Kwon and Co. are up to.

wallstreetbet,"Marijuana violations have taken over 10,000 truck drivers off the road this year, adding more supply chain disruptionsPublished:¬†May. 19, 2022 at 11:26 AM EDT

(Stacker) - Delayed packages, bare grocery store shelves, and¬†inflated prices¬†have become the norm for American consumers over the past two years. While the COVID-19 pandemic has been the catalyst, there are other challenges causing supply chain issues, including a lack of truck drivers to transport goods from one place to another. In late 2021, the American Trucking Associations reported that the¬†driver shortage had risen to an all-time high¬†of 80,000, partly due to the aging population and shrinking wages.

In response, the Biden administration vowed in December to get more truck drivers on the road by boosting recruitment efforts and expediting the issuing of commercial licenses. However, that won‚Äôt have an effect on another hurdle: disparate marijuana laws across the U.S. that are contributing to an increase in violations. In 2022, a growing number of truckers are being taken off the job, which could soon worsen the already suffering supply chain.

As more states legalize recreational marijuana‚Äîfour of which did so in the past year and three more are expected to by the end of 2022‚Äîmore truck drivers have tested positive for the substance. As of April 1, 2022,¬†10,276 commercial vehicle drivers have tested positive for marijuana use.¬†By the same time in 2021, there had been 7,750 violations. That‚Äôs a 32.6% increase year over year.

Truck drivers who travel cross-country face inconsistent state regulations as¬†19 states have legalized recreational marijuana¬†and¬†37 states permit it for medicinal purposes. But even if a driver used marijuana or hemp-based products like CBD while off duty in a state where those substances are legal, they could still be faced with a violation due to the Department of Transportation‚Äôs (DOT) zero-tolerance policy at the federal level.

‚ÄúWhile states may allow medical use of marijuana, federal laws and policy do not recognize any legitimate medical use of marijuana,‚Äù a DOT handbook for commercial vehicle drivers reads. ‚ÄúEven if a state allows the use of marijuana, DOT regulations treat its use as the same as the use of any other illicit drug.‚Äù

Stacker¬†looked at what‚Äôs causing thousands of truckers to be removed from their jobs, and the looming domino effect of the continued supply chain disruptions.

Truck drivers are being tested more and the consequences for drug-related violations have increased

Under regulations set forth by the DOT, truck drivers are tested for drug use‚Äîincluding marijuana‚Äîprior to starting a new job. They can also be tested at random, as well as after accidents. In January 2020, the DOT‚Äôs¬†Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration¬†also upped the random drug testing rate from 25% of the average number of driver positions to 50%. Truck drivers are mainly screened for drug use via urinalysis, but there are now new saliva tests being proposed as well.

At worst, if a driver fails just one drug test, that can be grounds for termination under DOT regulations. At best, they are temporarily taken off the road and required to complete an evaluation with a substance misuse professional who determines their rehabilitation process, which can sometimes take months.

As of January 2020, employers are also required to list commercial drivers who fail a drug test in the¬†FMCSA‚Äôs Drug &amp; Alcohol Clearinghouse. These violations remain searchable for five years. Potential employers are also required to check the Clearinghouse to see if a commercial driver had any previous violations, which would prevent them from being hired.

Differing marijuana laws by state are causing confusion among truck drivers

In recent years, more states have legalized both recreational and medical marijuana, making it more widely available and used. However, marijuana use is still prohibited for commercial truck drivers, state laws and medical prescriptions aside. According to the FMCSA, ‚Äúa driver may not use marijuana even if [it] is recommended by a licensed medical practitioner.‚Äù The DOT has maintained its¬†zero-tolerance stance for marijuana use¬†even as it‚Äôs become legalized, saying, ‚ÄúLegalization of marijuana use by States and other jurisdictions also has not modified the application of U.S. Department of Transportation drug testing regulations.‚Äù

A commercial driver could use marijuana while off-duty, not driving, and in a state where marijuana is legal, but still test positive for the substance for up to a month later and be taken off the road. The¬†American Addiction Centers¬†says for infrequent marijuana users‚Äîmeaning those who use the substance less than two times a week‚Äîit can show up in their urine for up to three days. Someone who uses marijuana several times a week can test positive for up to three weeks, and those who use marijuana even more frequently can ‚Äútest positive for a month or longer.‚Äù

Truck drivers with violations tend to not return, adding to the shortage and supply chain woes

Shortages, factory closures, and goods waiting to be unloaded at ports are just some of the current issues affecting the supply chain across America. Trucking transports 72% of products within the U.S., according to a report from the White House, but a growing number of commercial drivers are sidelined for marijuana use.

The return-to-duty process that commercial vehicle drivers must undergo once faced with a marijuana violation can keep them from returning to work at all. According to the FMCSA‚Äôs monthly report, 89,650 commercial drivers are currently in prohibited status as of April 1, 2022, but 67,368 of them have not begun the RTD process.¬†

If violations continue at the current rate, the truck driver shortage will further disrupt the supply chain, which means higher prices not just for commodities but the cost of living at large.

# Transmission

Transmission of monkeypox virus occurs when a person comes into contact with the virus from an animal, human, or materials contaminated with the virus. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), **respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth).** Animal-to-human transmission may occur by bite or scratch, bush meat preparation, direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, or indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated bedding. **Human-to-human transmission is thought to occur primarily through large respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required.** Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.

The reservoir host (main disease carrier) of monkeypox is still unknown although African rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The virus that causes monkeypox has only been recovered (isolated) twice from an animal in nature. In the first instance (1985), the virus was recovered from an apparently ill African rodent (rope squirrel) in the Equateur Region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the second (2012), the virus was recovered from a dead infant mangabey found in the Tai National Park, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire.

Also, directly from the CDC. Link: [https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html) 

# Signs and Symptoms

In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox. Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy) while smallpox does not. **The incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 7‚àí14 days but can range from 5‚àí21 days.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** So from the CDC's own lips we have a virus that mainly transmits (human-to-human) airborne through large respiratory droplets (sound familiar?) that has an incubation period up to 14 days (sound familiar?).

The reservoir host (main disease carrier) of monkeypox is still unknown although African rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The virus that causes monkeypox has only been recovered (isolated) twice from an animal in nature. In the first instance (1985), the virus was recovered from an apparently ill African rodent (rope squirrel) in the Equateur Region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the second (2012), the virus was recovered from a dead infant mangabey found in the Tai National Park, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire.

 \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, directly from the CDC. Link: [https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html) 

# Signs and Symptoms

In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox. Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy) while smallpox does not. T**he incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 7‚àí14 days but can range from 5‚àí21 days.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: So from the CDC's own lips we have a virus that mainly transmits (human-to-human) airborne through large respiratory droplets (sound familiar?) that has an incubation period up to 14 days (sound familiar?).

&gt;  
&gt;Before visiting U.S. and South Korean troops monitoring the rapidly evolving North Korean nuclear threat, Biden said the U.S. was ready for any provocation that Kim Jong Un might deliver.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Hyundai's investment](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-hyundai) includes $5.5 billion for an electric vehicle and battery factory in Georgia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Appearing with Biden, Hyundai CEO Euisun Chung said Sunday his company would spend another $5 billion on artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles and other technologies.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Electric vehicles are good for our climate goals, but they‚Äôre also good for jobs,"" Biden said. ""And they‚Äôre good for business.""

wallstreetbet,"I made an investing strategy tracking Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speeches (guh)\# Intro

Hey everyone! I'm the guy who built the \[Inverse Cramer ETF\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this\_is\_actually\_beating\_the\_sp\_by\_over\_30\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/)), as well as the \[South Park investing strategy\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/uq1tbr/oc\_an\_investing\_strategy\_that\_tracks\_south\_park/i8sjoq4/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/uq1tbr/oc_an_investing_strategy_that_tracks_south_park/i8sjoq4/?context=3)). Tl;dr - these meme strategies \*seem\* to work (I'm working on turning these into real ETFs, because they've gotten considerable attention)

&amp;#x200B;

What I wanted to see next, based on some \[WallStreetBets comments\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i\_built\_the\_inverse\_cramer\_index\_what\_should\_i\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/)), was whether I could find either an equity or an options strategy based on the JPow's speeches that seemed to have worked historically. Here's what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

\# The Data

I took all the data I could find on Powell's speech dates \[from C-Span\]([https://www.c-span.org/search/?sdate=&amp;edate=&amp;congressSelect=&amp;yearSelect=&amp;searchtype=Videos&amp;sort=Most+Recent+Airing&amp;text=0&amp;personid%5B%5D=17815](https://www.c-span.org/search/?sdate=&amp;edate=&amp;congressSelect=&amp;yearSelect=&amp;searchtype=Videos&amp;sort=Most+Recent+Airing&amp;text=0&amp;personid%5B%5D=17815)). Ended up being quite a few hundred videos. I wasn't looking for any bullish/bearish content from the speech. The signal I was looking to test for with this strategy was - can we glean any market information from the time of JPow's speeches, and/or do market participants act differently shortly after his speech?

&amp;#x200B;

\# The Strategy

Fuck JPow right? So anyways, I tracked the S&amp;P with 100% of the portfolio. Whenever JPow spoke, I reallocated 15% of the portfolio into daily puts (at the specific time of the speech). Used the same purchase price as strike price, so I benefit from a directional bet rather than a magnitude one.

&amp;#x200B;

I also did this with strategy with calls for fun. First time I've done an options strategy, so any feedback here is welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

\## Execution

&amp;#x200B;

In execution, it looked like this:

\- Took all the dates that JPow was speaking

\- Used the adjusted close/open to factor in dividends and splits

\- If you've followed along \[my posts before\]([http://reddit.com/u/SchemeElectronic9058](http://reddit.com/u/SchemeElectronic9058)), I always start off with a naive algorithm as a sanity check. If I'm able to get some sort of signal without doing much work on structuring the data, that makes me happy because there might be some kind of strong signal that you don't have to do statistical magic for

	\- The naive algorithms used equities. What if we bought the SPY the day of JPow's speech, then sold either at end of day, or at open the next day

	\- This time, the naive algorithm failed. Becaue you're mostly out of the S&amp;P, you don't get all the upside of the last 4 years. \*\*In hindsight, the naive algorithm (and using equities) was pretty fucking stupid.\*\* You'd have to have the thesis that the S&amp;P has the biggest jumps only on days JPow speaks, and is otherwise flat or in a bear market

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, then I tried a daily options strategy. When JPow's speech is released on C-Span, I bought an option the next hour, and exercised by the end of day.

&amp;#x200B;

\# The Performance

&amp;#x200B;

\*See next comment - this one got too long with performance data attached

&amp;#x200B;

Again, the naive ones didn't do BAD - they just weren't exciting, and were really what you'd expect. Staying in cash most of the time and not making any big bets on direction means you're going to stay relatively flat (therefore beat probably 95% of WSB)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## PUT Portfolio

This was the strategy that reallocated 15% into puts right at the start of JPow's speech (or start of the next trading day), and exercised/let expire at the end of the closest trading day.

&amp;#x200B;

\## CALL Portfolio

This portfolio did worse than the PUT portfolio when you look at the end of our trading period vs the start, but it did have some really, really good moments in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the graphs for the people who can't read:

&amp;#x200B;

\# Conclusion

So, yeah - JPow doesn't fucking have predictive power. Was a pretty stupid idea in hindsight. What we did learn here is that JPow's speech dates are very much a confounding factor - he speaks during times of crisis, meaning following them is a play on trading volatility.

&amp;#x200B;

The best strategy based on the results here seems to be buying puts on a daily basis when there are inklings of panic and volatility, and then buying calls when you're sure people are panicked, scared, and volatile. You'll lose your bet most days, but when you're right, you're right big."

wallstreetbet,"There is no bubbleThat's right. You read it here first. I should be more specific though in that equities aren't in a bubble. I've seen charts showing our imminent economic demise, but what I haven't seen is anyone showing charts about the value of indices adjusted for the US Dollar Index ([DXY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index)) and the money supply ([M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)).

I present to you two charts; the NDX and SPX adjusted for these two factors. How do we adjust for them? If the DXY goes up, this means your dollar is more valuable, so we multiply by it. JPow firing up the money printer means your dollar is worth less, so we divide by it.

# NDX

https://preview.redd.it/ai120eyuty091.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca942042de2ed1925c62dcbc235155da9a01bf4

We'll start with the NDX. From '87 to '00 this blew up. We're talking 2,502% over the course of over 12 years, with the vast majority of that happening in the second half of that period. From November '87 to May of '95, it increased by 178% and then went on to gain 836% from May '95 to March '00. That's fucking wild and it's definitely a bubble

Looking from the bottom of the financial crisis forward you don't see the same characteristics. There's been an orderly increase that's fairly linear on a log scale and it grew at a much more modest rate. Comparing the CAGRs between the two periods shows that the adjusted NDX grew at about half the rate for the second period. It also hasn't even reached the ATH that was set during the tech bubble. We would need to see an adjusted increase of 93% to get there.

https://preview.redd.it/9ai4hgrgvy091.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3410737872b5735a7d0206dbe1c2b35dedf9c74

# SPX

https://preview.redd.it/06gu7u0yty091.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e85967aebe3c9e6489ac28c9440a76d8e3a26fcb

Looking at the SPX you see a very similar story, though decidedly less dramatic. Similar parabolic rally in the first period, fairly linear growth in the second. For this comparison I took it to its peak in December '21. The SPX hasn't even hit its adjusted peak from '20 just before the COVID crash let alone gotten anywhere near the ATH set in '00. To reach the prior ATH we would need an adjusted 95% increase. We're also barely above levels from '02 to '07 and we'd need a decline of about 4.5% to get to the peak in '07.

https://preview.redd.it/9s2mi881vy091.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4277fdee81b42c36459329c70684dd83b4bb7006

# Conclusion

Equities aren't in a bubble. What we're seeing as far as increases in the NDX and SPX is largely driven by inflation. Does this mean the market won't go to shit? Probably not. There's a lot of other factors at play. Personally I don't see a full on 2008 meltdown happening, but anything's possible. My guess is we chop sideways for a year or so while the economy normalizes."

wallstreetbet,"if you missed the COVID-19 run up on PFE or BNTX in 2020, don't miss this Monkey Pox playMonkey Pox outbreak is currently written off as:

""not contagious""
""definitely won't be another COVID""
""transmission is not airborne""

But that's what they said about COVID-19 in January 2020.

------

Anomalies of this current Monkey Pox outbreak of 2022:

Already identified in many countries as of today, latest ones including Australia, Israel and Switzerland. Last week, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and the US (Massachusetts) had its first cases. (totalling 100 cases) 

Never before had the outbreak been this viral. Even Nigeria, where this Monkey Pox is endemic, officially only had 558 cases with 8 deaths over 2017-2022. That's like 100 cases a year on average. Yet right now we are having 100 cases in 1 week, spread across Europe.

__What I posit:__
1. The strain might have mutated to become more viral (like COVID-19 did) 
2. Transmission is airborne (maybe due to a mutation) 
3. Incubation period of 2 weeks makes it hard to thwart and detect (like COVID-19) / countries don't know how to detect it yet
4. Other unforeseen factors related to covid infections/vaccinations? idk. 

__Play:__
I'm not saying that monkey pox will be another covid that will cripple the world. Maybe 1 in a million chance, it might. This would be the bull case. 

My play is simply hope that the governments of the world will be afraid enough of the monkey pox that they'd start ordering vaccines from the producers. 

Fact: some of the already has. 
1. __Bavarian Nordic (BAVA)__ shares shot up __almost 2x__ when they got some large orders of the monkey pox vaccines 

2. U.S. Patent holder and producer of the monkey pox vaccine, __Emergent BioSolutions (EBS)__ hasn't announced any orders yet, but their shares have gone up from $26 to $35. In its heyday in 2020 when people were buying up biotech stocks blindly, it went to as high as $130 -- this was just a FOMO run up because EBS has nothing to do with COVID-19nor were they developing any vaccines for COVID-19. But right now for the Monkey Pox outbreak, they are the ones that will be stepping up to be the main cast, the Iron Man superhero fighting against the monkey pox villain. Can you imagine how high this stock would run up to?

3. There's a spike in options traded volume in EBS $60 strike, Dec 2022 expiry. 350 lots bought, spent __$70k__. If EBS went back to $130, that position will be worth at least __$2 million__. It might be someone in the CDC, or might just be speculators. 

4. EBS in itself is a very healthy company. Growing revenue year on year, currently at over a billion dollars. And gross profit margin of around 50% is above the industry watermark. Minimal debt and free cashflow is piling up every year. P/E ratio of 10 is a little high but you do pay a premium for a healthy company. Fun fact: They do own the patent to the vaccine of the anthrax virus as well. It's never bad to own a piece of a healthy company."

wallstreetbet,"How retarded is my trading strategyHear me out. You can buy SPY calls that expire in 2 days at a strike price of $350 for around $38 a contract. It's extremely unlikely that an index as safe and predictable as that will fall 10% in 2 days from its current price of $390. There are a litany of other stocks out there that will, but if SPY does that so quickly we've got much bigger and more impactful economic issues than just losing money on options. 

That means that i can generate a gross profit of roughly 10% every 2 days, or around 150% per month. It is exorbitantly unlikely that all of my trades end up in the money. So let's say that I'm right around half of the time, and thus generate 5% per trade 15 times a month, or 75% per month. 

Through compound interest that means that i can turn a principle of 5k into 903k in around a years time. That's before taxes and other considerations. 

This of course seems is far to good to be true. And I'm pretty sure that my math isn't fully accounting for the extent of losses that i can incur. 

Surely there are other apes out there that thought of this and proceeded to lose money hand over fist. What am i not considering that makes this strategy dumb."

Don‚Äôt give them anything. Or if you have to give them as less as possible. 
If needed you can go to into some debt on your banking card (IF it doesn‚Äôt give you penalty fees) 
But what you need to calculate is the cost of losing the opportunity by missing future gains. And the cost that it cost you to go into debt right now. 
If you have a stable income where you know that the short term debt that you re taken by going up to 1000-2000 dollars into bank card penalties won‚Äôt be a problem to refund next month. And holdings allows to go home for future gains that will be higher than the penalty fees."

Observing the chart one can see that as enthusiasm as measured by the Month-over-Month change in total average weekly meme-stock subreddit posts wanes so too does the price.

Furthermore, the short squeeze already happened. The stock went from $2 to $74. Over half of the comments made in meme subreddits occurred prior to May 2021 which was when enthusiasm was at its highest.

At this point I think that the handful of hopefuls left in the meme subreddits are the ultimate bag-holders. Completely deluded, cursing Kenny G every day and talking about conspiracy theories.

$EAR was in the news on September 23, 2021 because the DOJ announced an investigation into the company related to insurance claims. Analists at various firms like JPM, William Blair and others cut their targets by over 75%. 

$EAR management responded by withdrawing FY21 guidance, and shared that it was subject to an ongoing claims audit by its largest third-party payor. Why is this important? Shared slumped over 60% minutes after the announcement. 

The shares were trading around \~$21 around the time of the announcement. This is important to remember. 

Today (January 6, 2022), the news hit:

Like if there's a large company, and they pay their staff basically as little as possible, keep the staff from doing full time in order to not pay benefits, and generally is known for overworking and undervaluing staff.  I know it used to be a sign that the company is going to have some good profits, and stocks go up.  But more and more i'm worried that these companies will have massive disruption events from staff (like a strike or walk out).  They have to be getting hit on hiring in the current market where people aren't taking the lowest wage jobs anymore.  So they're going to have be be paying more which will increase their bottom line.

wallstreetbet,"Stonks with the highest and lowest Implied Volatilities relative to the pastHi guys,

it seems a lot of you are struggling with finding  stonks with low or high implied volatilities (relative to the past) as most retail brokers dont offer this data easily. Luckily, these days are gone, because by scraping  [Alpha Query](https://www.alphaquery.com/) you can get historical IV data for almost all major stocks (certainly those with weekly expirations).

To save you a lot of time and make sure you are on your golden path to tendies I have scraped past IVs for stonks with at least 1000 traded options on average per day in the last 90 days (to make sure there is at least some liquidity) with weekly expirations (data from [CBOE weekly options list](https://www.cboe.com/us/options/symboldir/weeklys_options/)). Data on average option volume can be obtained on [Market Chameleon Option Volume](https://marketchameleon.com/Reports/optionVolumeReport).

Here comes the magical file you have all been waiting for (unfortunately, I can not predict the bigest move 1 day in advance, so this will have to do it).

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFtUwDKHSyoPtQuowat9kCnCuFGFq5YCwDZlIdZ0R9k/edit?usp=sharing&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFtUwDKHSyoPtQuowat9kCnCuFGFq5YCwDZlIdZ0R9k/edit?usp=sharing&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

How to read this table? The first two columns Symbol and Date are pretty self-explanatory, Nrow means how many data points per Symbol were used for calculation of past quantiles, IV\_10d and IV\_30d are the implied volatility of the stock with weighted expiration 10 and 30 days from now (if there is no expiration exactly 10 or 30 days from now, IVs are weighted by taking the nearest expirations from above and below). The last two rows show how extreme current Ivs are relative to the past: So, if we look at GPRO, Past\_Quantile\_IV\_10d is 0.05 and Past\_Quantile\_IV\_30d is 0.01, which means that GPRO ATM options expiring on Jan 8th have low IVs relative to the past - only 5% of time it has been lower and ATM options expiring Feb 4th (29 days from now) have almost the lowest IV in history - only 1% of IVs in the past have been lower in the past. To put it more bluntly, because we have 1558 days with data for GPRO, only 15 days in history had lower IV that it is today, so BUY BUY BUY, because it is as low as it gets! If the Number in the last two columns is close to 1 (BABA), it means IVs are very high compared to the past, so selling options makes sense.

TL;DR Check the google docs link and buy options on stonks where the number in the last two columns is close to 0 and sell options if its close to 1."

wallstreetbet,"Sonos might be worth a lottoHi all, 

I'm back with more under the radar Sonos DD. 

Sometime this afternoon (most likely afterhours) the Sonos/Google patent case is going to get its final ruling by the ITC.  In the first round Sonos won, so right now its up to the ITC to decide if they want to go ahead and enforce the ruling as is or let Google continue to infringe on Sonos's patents.  

Given the political winds nationally, its highly unlikely that they allow Google to get away with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.  Especially given how innovative of a company Sonos is.   

I'm expecting a ruling to go in favor of Sonos and Sonos to see a similar bump they did when the last ruling came down (+15% opened even higher at close to +30%).  

This might be worth a 1DTE lotto.  I tossed down 100 Sonos 1/7 calls at the 30 strike.  Obviously do your own DD and understand your risk tolerance, but I expecting good things from this underrated company."

Where I am trying to get at is that the US and China are #1 and #2 in world power and who stands to gain the most with the down fall of both countries.... Russia!

The Reset that is coming is a Russian Government agency lead move to put power back into Russia hands Pre WW2. Forget about communist government and economic systems. We will soon be in a Oligarchy Government and Economy with groups of people in control or a Forum broken down into sectors such as Pharma/Tech/Food ETC....

wallstreetbet,"Solid Power Inc - Ford's and BMW's Secret EV Weapon (upcoming catalysts) I am just trying to get some awareness out there for a stock that has some pretty huge catalysts coming up. Solid Power Inc (SLDP) recently dipped under $7, even though it has formal backing from Ford/BMW/IARPA/SKI and has undisclosed sales agreements with Redwire (Redditors found it, can provide proof).

On to the short term catalyst, Solid Power is shipping the first round of OEM batteries to Ford and BMW in the next few months and has also been actively lobbying the US government in regards to the battery supply chain being a matter of national security. In regards to the ties to the government, SLDP recently hired a former Sr NASA exec to it's board of directors who just happens to be married to the current chief engineer at NASA.

The company is already fully funded through 2026 and is actively working with additional OEMs to secure more lines of revenue.

The stock also recently received it's first analyst cover by Needham, which gave it a ""Buy"" and a PT of $13. I expect larger firms to chime in soon.

Tie all this with a tiny free float compared to peers such as QS, this has the potential to fly soon.

Ford members were in SLDP facilities just two weeks ago according to SLDP‚Äôs CEO.

wallstreetbet,"Bull traps/bear traps don't happen every 15 minutes.You often see the phrase 'BEAR TRAP' and 'BULL TRAP' being yelled online. Any signal that misleads an investor is a trap in some sense. However, the real meaning for 'bear trap' and 'bull trap' refers to substantial long-term moves, not volatility.

You may also have seen this famous diagram: [**STAGES OF A BUBBLE**.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png/800px-Stages_of_a_bubble.png)

It was created by Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue and presented in 2008.

-------

Bear Trap
-----

After **years** of holding stocks at fairly stable, flat valuations, bears dump into the first nice rally that comes along. 

Then they spend **years** watching prices zoom upwards, while they hold cash, waiting for a crash that doesn't come.

Bull Trap
-----

After **years** of mania, bulls heavily buy into the first significant correction they see.

The bulls expect the mania will resume for **years** to come. It does not.

---------

**In both cases, the 'trap' plays out over a period of years, as a colossal opportunity cost or actual loss**.

It's *not* about seeing your portfolio vary sharply with daily, weekly or monthly movements. 

It's *not* about about losing +/- 10% of the index value. 

It's *not* about imbeciles crippling themselves with massive margin and options.

It's about **brutal, awful, suffering for ordinary investors** who pick the wrong strategy for the time.

-----

From March 2020 til January 2022, the SP500, the broadest popular measure of market valuation, rose from 2300, to 4800, more than doubling in price. Looking at Dr. Rodrigue's chart: are we looking at a potential *bull trap*, or a *bear trap*?"

wallstreetbet,"Shoutout to another OG autist, Nick Leeson, who brought down the UK's oldest bank by constantly doubling down when he lost. He lost the game when he bet on the Japanese market being stable one day before the huge Kobe earthquake hit.Nicholas William Leeson is an English criminal and former derivatives trader whose fraudulent, unauthorized and speculative trades resulted in the 1995 collapse of Barings Bank, the United Kingdom's oldest merchant bank, for which he served time in prison.

From 1992, Leeson made unauthorised speculative trades that at first made large profits for Barings: ¬£10 million, which accounted for 10% of Barings' annual profit. He earned a bonus of ¬£130,000 on his salary of ¬£50,000 for that year. Leeson's luck soon went sour and he used one of Barings' error accounts (accounts used to correct mistakes made in trading) to hide his losses. He says that this account was first used to hide an error made by one of his subordinates; she had been assigned to buy twenty futures contracts for Fuji Bank, but had sold them instead, costing Barings ¬£20,000. 

Obviously she deserves a place on WSB aswell. If you're out there girl, please identify yourself.

Leeson used this error account to cover further bad trades by himself and others. For example, he used it to cover a number of mistakes made by one of his traders who frequently came to work after long nights of partying. 

By the end of 1992, the error account's losses exceeded ¬£2 million, increasing to ¬£23 million in late 1993. This amount ballooned to ¬£208 million by the end of 1994.

**Leeson had followed a ""doubling"" strategy: every time he lost money, he would bet double the amount that was lost in order to recoup the amount.**

# FLAWLESS STRATEGY

This had been successful for him in the past, including once in 1993 where he was able to cover a ¬£6 million negative balance in the error account and after which he vowed not to use the account again. However, Leeson had to maintain his reputation as a trading genius and soon found himself hiding his losses there again. As the losses grew higher and higher, Leeson fabricated cover stories to explain why he needed more cash from London; his sterling reputation protected him from close scrutiny.

# PUTS ON EARTHQUAKES. 

The beginning of the end occurred on 16 January 1995, when Leeson placed a short straddle in the Singapore and Tokyo stock exchanges, essentially betting that the Japanese stock market would not move significantly overnight. However, the Kobe earthquake hit early in the morning on 17 January, sending Asian markets, and Leeson's trading positions, into a tailspin. Leeson attempted to recoup his losses by making a series of increasingly risky new trades (using a long-long future arbitrage), this time betting that the Nikkei Stock Average would make a rapid recovery. However, the recovery failed to materialise.

**So what next? Just say sorry - You retards should try this with Robinhood**

Leeson left a note reading, ""I'm sorry"" and fled Singapore on 23 February. Losses eventually reached ¬£827 million (US$1.4 billion), twice Barings' available trading capital. After a failed bailout attempt, Barings, which had been the UK's oldest merchant bank, was declared insolvent on 26 February. After fleeing to Malaysia, Thailand and finally Germany, Leeson was arrested in Frankfurt and extradited back to Singapore on 20 November 1995.

District judge Richard Magnus, who convicted Leeson, decided to sentence Leeson to six and a half years in Changi Prison in Singapore. Leeson was released in July 1999 after serving at least two-thirds of his sentence (4 years and 4 months) for good behaviour, and having been diagnosed with colon cancer, which he survived despite grim forecasts at the time. In 1996, Leeson published an autobiography, Rogue Trader, detailing his acts.

This particular strategy I‚Äôve read about tracks the CBOE and the SandP 500 and used T-bills as the collateral. 

I have been doing some reading on the strategy and the reports are very sesquipedalian and i cant seem to get a proper grasp on how the strategy actually works. I understand the strategy at a basic level however am not sure how the strategy is practically implemented. If anybody has any experience with using the strategy then i'd love hear how it works.

I also don't understand how insurance comes into play. One of the reports i read spoke on how in periods of high implied volatility, uncertain overall market sentiment can result in people wanting to protect their downside in fear of the underlying hitting its strike price. Is the 'insurance/protection' the Treasury bills that are bought at the same price as the underlying asset, or am i miss-understanding/missing something entirely."

Truly no sight of profits, a business model with no moat or leverage over the competition, and increasingly stringent regulations FOR PRIVATE OWNERS to rent their properties on their platform as the airbnb model has become an enemy of residential real estate. Marriot, which basically has it‚Äôs own properties and all that noise, is worth half. That being said, how the FUCK do ‚Äúprofessional analysts‚Äù disregard all the red flags and come on with these price targets? They never seem to be based off anything other than speculation this point. I am not an expert but trying to learn so be nice"

However, when looking at the S&amp;P500 futures contracts, the last couple of days of rising prices have occurred on falling volume. This is somewhat concerning as the lack of longs participating might indicate that this is simply a corrective bounce.

wallstreetbet,"SPY vs. QQQ for daily options tradingAlright so ive been exclusively trading SPY options since last year, however, i recently stumbled upon an article explaining how QQQ has an advantage over SPY when it comes to options trading... i did some testing and im kinda surprised to see the results. 

So lets break this down and im open for people's opinions here... 

SPYs top 10 holdings are apple, msft, google, amazon, berkshire, j&amp;j, p&amp;g and nvidia which those top 10 holdings make up 28% of its total asset weight.

QQQs top 10 holdings are apple, msft, google, amazon, tesla, nividia, paypal and adobe which those 10 make up 56% of its total asset weight. 

So comparatively its safe to say QQQ is easily swayed by its top 10 holdings while SPY isnt necessarily. Which accounts for why QQQ will usually move more in one day than SPY. 

Something else i wanted to compare was IV and overall gains/ losses. 

So lets take February 11th as an expiration. Say we take the next OTM call option for both spy and qqq for yesterday and compare them... 
SPY $450C had a premium of $6.17 at end of day and would have returned 50.12% gains. 
While QQQ $364C had a premium of $6.19 at end of day but would have returned 120.39% gains.
Thats nearly triple the gains... 
Its noted the spread on the QQQ call was 0.10 while SPY was only 0.05. 

Now assume we were wrong and we bought the next otm put. 
SPY $449p is $7.02 and would have returned -41%. 
Qqq $363P is $7.42 and returned -49.5%. 

So had you been wrong you would have only lost 8.5% more but had you been right itd been 2.5x the gains for roughly the same premium. 

Spy volume- 152.5M
Qqq volume- 94.3M


So this leads me to the question. Is QQQ actually better when it comes to options trading than SPY?"

TL;DR, got wiped to the tune of 500k writing naked puts"
wallstreetbet,"Dad will not stop trading, despite pleading from familyCross post from personal finance

Hi Reddit,

Throwaway for obvious reasons; I'm coming to Reddit because I have nowhere else to turn to for advice.

While I am far from being even knowledgeable about the stock market, I will do my best to explain in detail what has happened.

My dad started trading stocks regularly in March 2020, when the pandemic hit. While my parents have kept their jobs, my dad is always someone who spends most of his time on side projects that have had varying degrees of success (but have not been very profitable for him), and I believe trading is his newest passion project.

My dad earned few thousand dollars trading before a short call went wrong sometime around April 2020. Here, he lost about $400,000, wiping out years of savings that my parents were likely holding for their retirement. After realizing his mistake, he promised to play safely in the stock market, and keep my mother (who is literate with stocks and does some trading herself) updated with his trades to make sure he didn‚Äôt go overboard any longer.

However, as he began to slowly earn his money back, he became more confident. Largely unbeknownst to my mother, he switched to placing short puts at very high leverage that paid off and quickly earned his losses back by the end of 2021. Now, I believe is when he began to feel invincible, to a sense: when my mom found out a few months ago, she pleaded for him to stop playing at such high-risk margins and to quit while he was ahead. However, because my dad was making his losses back, she wasn‚Äôt very aggressive. Instead, she remained a nervous wreck for the past few months. This ruined our home life during this time, as both my parents became consumed by constantly checking the market, alongside their full-time jobs, leaving no time for the rest of the family.

Unfortunately, my mom‚Äôs fears were realized as dad‚Äôs winning streak didn‚Äôt last. This past Friday (1/21), he placed a risky short put set for Monday (1/17). My mom was extremely worried over the weekend, given analysts' projections and the usual insane amount of leverage that my dad had on his trades.

As many of you likely have guessed, this didn‚Äôt end well for my dad. As the market tanked Monday, he realized that his trades had put him in the same hole he was in just 2 years ago, at a near half-million-dollar ($500,000) loss this time. Despite him lying to her about managing his risk, my mom agreed to forgive him (albeit after quite a bit of arguing) if he stopped trading altogether.

He has agreed to significantly reduce his portfolio to significantly reduce his risk, in order to have a higher amount of liquidation to handle further market turbulence.

Here‚Äôs the problem: my mom and I don‚Äôt fully believe him, or in him. As stated before, he has already lied about managing risk before this. While this is a step further than he was willing to go last time, neither of us know if he will increase his portfolio size again when he has gained some money back, or somehow lose hundreds of thousands by finding a new avenue of trading, even with a smaller portfolio. Despite earning well for themselves my parents cannot afford to keep losing like this, especially with them aging close to retirement age (mid 50s).

My mom has threatened divorce if my dad keeps trading, which I see as a fair option under the circumstances, as this has ruined her life for the past year or so (albeit she is extremely reluctant to), and she should try to financially protect herself. While he claims he values our family, I don‚Äôt see him stopping trading any time soon, as he ""already has been through this once,"" claiming that ‚Äúit would be stupid to exit the market right now, that‚Äôs what the hedge funds want so they can buy back in.‚Äù

I have tried pleading with my dad on my mother‚Äôs behalf, to no avail. I just want my parents to be happy and have a happy retirement. My mom is at the end of her rope, and both of us are out of ideas on how to appeal to my dad.

Are my mom and I being crazy? Is there a way that I can appeal to my dad? Is divorce a good idea for my mom?

If anyone actually read through all this. Thank you, even if you don‚Äôt have any advice to give.

Tl;dr dad won‚Äôt stop (fully) trading after gaining confidence despite losing a ton of money in the stock market after gaining confidence, despite pleading from our family."

AFRM is down from an ATH of $160+

They aren‚Äôt worth $160 but I easily see this pumping to high-mid $80s when they blast through earnings. Way oversold.

Pros of the trade:

-They have a ton of institutional ownership. 
-Oversold af
-Going to pump on earnings due to Apple doing well (partnership)
-Lost all value from Amazon partnership pump
-Economic Growth last quarter is due for an inventible growth in consumer spending (higher earnings/volume)
-Double Bottomed and solid resistance

Cons of the trade:

-Company not Profitable yet (who is?)
-Had a decent past few days so IV is high
-Might be a quick flip
-Fuck you


This is a suggestion. I‚Äôm retarded and already balls deep in the trade so obviously a pump is good for me.

wallstreetbet,"Throwback to an OG Autist who under the radar amassed a $72B futures position and nearly took down Soc GenIt‚Äôs not a normal ‚Äì or low risk ‚Äì trading practice to amass a securities position that‚Äôs nearly five times the total economic output of Cambodia‚Ä¶ or 1.5 times the market capitalization of the major global bank you‚Äôre working for. It‚Äôs even less normal if the bank you‚Äôre working for has no clue about what you‚Äôre doing.
Jerome Kerviel was a junior level derivatives trader earning US$66,000 per year at Societe Generale, one of Europe‚Äôs
largest banks
By January 9, 2008, he had amassed a stock index futures position of US$73 billion. The way he did so ended up costing Societe Generale (SocGen) US$7.2 billion ‚Äì six times what Nick Leeson lost for Barings.


Derivatives are investment instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset, like a stock, a market index, the price of oil and so forth. There are different kinds of derivatives like futures, options, forwards and swaps that track the underlying asset in different ways.

Kerviel had dug himself a hole by buying 30 billion euros‚Äô worth of Eurostoxx pan-European stock index futures contracts, 18 billion euros of Germany‚Äôs DAX futures and 2 billion euros of London‚Äôs FTSE futures. These contracts expired over the following 1 to 3 months. Futures are derivatives used to essentially bet on the future price of a stock index. Kerviel bought them in the hope these markets would go up over the following months.

Kerviel‚Äôs job was to profit when two securities that should have the same price temporarily don‚Äôt have the same price ‚Äì which is called arbitrage. The idea is to buy the cheaper security, sell the more expensive one, and then wait for their prices to converge.

For example, if the stock price for Coca-Cola is trading at US$45 on the New York Stock Exchange, but the equivalent of US$44.90 on the London Stock Exchange, an arbitrage trader would be short Coca-Cola in New York (to profit when the price goes down), and buy it, or go long, in London (to profit when the price rises.) Then when the prices converge, with one going higher, the other lower, he makes money.


Kerviel bought Euro stock market futures hoping they would go up. Normally, he would have offset these bets by, for instance, shorting U.S. stock index futures (to profit if markets go down). In this way, if European stocks suddenly fell, the short U.S. stock futures ‚Äì which tend to move in the same direction as European stock futures ‚Äì would make money, offsetting the loss.

Because the price difference between similar securities may be small (in the Coca-Cola example, the 10- cent difference is an enormous spread for arbitrage traders), it‚Äôs normal for arbitrage traders to buy huge positions, and use leverage, or borrowed money, to make them even larger. That way they can make big profits even if the difference in price is tiny.

However, in the months leading up to January 9, 2008, Kerviel had learned how to hack SocGen‚Äôs risk surveillance system and was only doing one half of the arbitrage trade. In other words, Kerviel had been taking, say, long positions and offsetting them with short positions that didn‚Äôt exist.

By manipulating the bank‚Äôs software, he was making risky one-sided bets when his firm thought he was making lower-risk arbitrage trades. Kerviel reportedly made nearly US$2 billion in profits in 2007 by making these kinds of unauthorized trades.


Astoundingly, it was later discovered by SocGen that the massive trade Kerviel entered in early January 2008 was actually an attempt by Kerviel to lose money. (It worked extremely well.) He believed the previous year‚Äôs US$2 billion in unauthorised bank profits was about to be discovered. He feared he might lose his job, and was trying to generate losses to mask his fraud.

This may explain why Kerviel was betting on markets going higher, despite the fact that the subprime mortgage crisis was just beginning. Global markets were looking wobbly and astute traders were going short, or betting on markets going down ‚Äì the opposite of what Kerviel was doing.

The first indication that something was wrong at SocGen came in the afternoon of Friday January 18, when a compliance officer discovered that a trade had exceeded the bank‚Äôs risk threshold. When he checked with a brokerage that had supposedly executed an offsetting trade, he learned that no such trade existed.

In the last hour of trading on January 18, the price of SocGen stock plunged 8 percent. News sources reported that speculation of impending huge write-downs at the bank was the cause of the decline. Apparently, word of Kerviel‚Äôs huge bet had leaked out. 

As the extent of the fraud became apparent to banking officials over that weekend, Kerviel was fired. However, bank executives still had to deal with the US$73 billion worth of long futures, which at that point had already lost the bank US$1.4 billion.

Indications were that Monday‚Äôs stock market was going to experience more weakness ‚Äì no doubt made worse by the rumors that SocGen was in trouble. Bank executives were faced with a choice: Let the unauthorised trades run their course and hope the stock market would eventually rally, or close the positions immediately to avoid losing even more money.

After a difficult debate, with the future of the bank possibly at stake, bank officials decided to sell the positions as quickly as possible. FromJanuary 21 to 23, SocGen ‚Äúunwound‚Äù the futures contracts purchased by Kerviel, selling them into the market. Selling US$73 billion worth of futures in that short period of time drove prices of the futures even lower ‚Äì making the bank‚Äôs losses worse.

When the last of the unauthorised positions was sold, and the dust had settled, Jerome Kerviel had lost SocGen US$7.2 billion, making him the worst rogue trader in history, at least in terms of money lost."

wallstreetbet,"Buy A.P. M√∏ller ‚Äì M√¶rsk (AKMBY)What they do?

A.P. M√∏ller ‚Äì M√¶rsk A/S (pronounced [Àà…õÀÄ Ààp ∞eÃùÀÄ m√∏l…êÀàm…õ…êÃØsk]), also known simply as Maersk (/m…õ…ôrsk/),[4] is a Danish shipping company, active in ocean and inland freight transportation and associated services, such as supply chain management and port operation.[5] Maersk has been the largest container shipping line and vessel operator in the world since 1996. The company is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, with subsidiaries and offices across 130 countries and around 83,000 employees worldwide in 2020.

So now why buy?

1. Shipping is and will always be in high demand and will not die out unless Musk can replace Maersk with his name by inventing a teleport machine that can move tonnes of shit from Asia to Europe in a split sec.

2. When you go to some of the busiest ports in the US, you will notice that the name Maersk is on at least fucking 60% of all containers, the rest being Yang Ming, Cosco, Hapag-Lloyd, ONE etc. and shit.

3. Maersk, which was already on track for record profits, the largest ever for any Danish company, increased its profit forecast ($24B) by nearly five percent and free cash flow ($16.4B) from operations by more than 13 percent. Also note that the company is not based in a shitty part of Europe like Montenegro or Ukraine or whatever. That matters a lot.

wallstreetbet,"Shorting McDonaldsHello all,

I noticed a roughly 3% increase in $MCD stock. After some DD at the drive thru, I came to the conclusion it was likely due to  their Land, Air, and Sea sandwiches; consisting of chicken, fish, and beef. 

I have a Robinhood card which allows a $5000 daily limit as well a various other cards. How feasible would it be to purchase all of sandwiches everyday from each location in my area/state, causing more supplies needed to be sent to the store, and then a shortage of sandwiches at McDonalds, so really bad for their PR and thus many upset customers. I could also leave bad reviews on the Better Business Bureau website.

If I fib a little about my income on a Fidelity Visa card application, it seems like I could get a limit well over 20k. After doing this I could withdraw via cashback and transfer over to Webull who has a 4x margin short feature, and short McDonalds. So this would be 80k that will increase after bad news. Then I pay Robinhood, and Fidelity  back from the slight interest accumulated prior to the tanking.

What do you guys think? Thanks!"

wallstreetbet,"Poor Man's BloombergHi, my favorite fellow retards,

How is money losing going, are we having fun? Have you got your platinum membership yet?

I have been working on something that can seriously benefit you and I am here to share it with all of you, for fucking free.

Are you a retard who buys GME without any research because others told you to? Are you someone who wants to take your gamble game back into your hands? Are you jealous of analysts doing their shit with a 20k dollar Bloomberg terminal but all you have is a robinhood account with fading internet connection?

Well do I have just the thing for you.

I present Poorman‚Äôs Bloomberg. But for potential copyright issue and more ~~artistic~~ autistic feeling, it‚Äôs now called Vagrant Bloom:

vagrantbloom.com

this is already the second iteration of the web app. I made an MVP or V1.0 before which used a completely different tech stack, and I remember looking at it and thought this looks like shit, it may be on a completely different autism level than where I was. So, I said fuck it, and started again from scratch and built this one, and now it‚Äôs finally ready to meet my fellow autists.

Let me tell you how it can help you.

First thing you will notice is that you don‚Äôt have the sign in or make an account bullshit, my goal is enabling you to do your research cutting all those bullshits.

When you get on it you are greeted with this fucking awesome thing. It‚Äôs a search center, where you type in any symbol, and you can search for it in all the places that might remotely interest you. Who said retails can‚Äôt do research huh?

 https://imgur.com/ZoV3VuK 

You keep forgetting shit you need to track like CPI, Yield Curve, or your favorite WSB DDs? the Search center have links to those places too, you can go to town and look (I know you don‚Äôt read) at them all.

Next you see is a sentiment, which is gotten in real time based on whatever those degenerates on stocktwits are saying. If you want, you can also click on the green button on the top bar to expand and see their messages

[https://imgur.com/ZVvNFYa](https://imgur.com/ZVvNFYa)

You know how to lose less money? Don‚Äôt buy calls when some shit IPO lockup is over. But how can you track that? The answer is simple, vagrant bloom has an IPO lockup tracker for your tiny brains. You must expand the table to see it because I don‚Äôt want the website to look like shit.

[https://imgur.com/QVfpEe4](https://imgur.com/QVfpEe4)

Now I know none of you can do actual TA, only doodling a batman on a SPY 5 seconds chart, so here is a finviz TA section that does it for you:

[https://imgur.com/dsHp7tj](https://imgur.com/dsHp7tj)

Next let‚Äôs head to the Stock section, don‚Äôt know how to get to it? Click this thing on the top, there is also where you type in the ticker in your interest:

[https://imgur.com/qHzwpKy](https://imgur.com/qHzwpKy)

As you can see the search center is still there and whatever you typed in is preserved. You can search more here.

But your attention should be here:

[https://imgur.com/c00De8E](https://imgur.com/c00De8E)

Are you still arguing about an AMC squeeze quoting some fucktard on the internet saying it still has 180% shares shorted? Well I have facts here for you, it ‚Äúonly‚Äù has 18.95 percent shares shorted at the moment, so is it gonna squeeze? I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm a retard. But the facts are here

[https://imgur.com/z158NJz](https://imgur.com/z158NJz)

And then we have the good old news:

[https://imgur.com/Me0pEPd](https://imgur.com/Me0pEPd)

We have stocktwits sentiments too.

Next up is pretty fucking genius, insider transactions from openinsider.com. Here I have summarized what percentage of transactions and shares were sold by insiders, so you know how insiders are seeing their stock price.

And you see Ellis recently just sold 99% of his holding, it‚Äôs so intuitive with a progress bar isn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm sure he is a big believer of another big squeeze, fingers crossed.

[https://imgur.com/UF97TgN](https://imgur.com/UF97TgN)

And then we have some institutional holders, I don‚Äôt know if this is useful but here you go.

I have to point out that almost everything is collapsible/expandable, you can make your page as neat as possible or as expanded as possible, the control is yours.

Vagrant Bloom is by no means a finished product. I introduce it here today and want to utilize the power of this group to make it better, and my goal is one day us poor retailers can proudly say we have a all in one place to do our own research. So, if you have any feedback or good idea on some features, let me know down below.

Right now I am running everything on my expense. If you think I did a good job and want to support this project. You can consider click on the top right comer to buy me a coffee, or click on the links in Recommendation section to show your support.

It stands to reason he was protecting his financial firm Easthill Capital Management and likely has insider information before selling Easthill's shares.  I'm curious when the SEC will get involved and if any class action lawsuits could develop."

Do you really think the arguably most successful investor of all time would buy 40B worth of shares if he thought the entire economy was collapsing? He scooped up $600M worth of apple even though he already owns $159B dollars of the company.
I'll bet you my wife that he scooping up more apple as we speak. 

Scraps for the bears... 

Have we reached peak earnings? Yes
Is the economy slowing down? Yes 

However, the consumer is still spending on travel. Listen to Delta earnings call, CEO said he saw record demand for April. ABNB reported solid earnings and guided positively for Q2. The consumer is coping with Inflation for now. 
Look at this shit...Bond market has had its worst start since the 1700's because some dipshits believe that Jerome Powell is the next Paul Volcker. The bafoon admitted in November that his transitory call was wrong yet he didn't start raising interest rates until March. Larry Summers and Mohammed El Erian begged him to start raising last year but he just kept on going. Rates don't get above 2% before the entire economy collapses and he pivots.

Key Points (more detail in link)

 

&gt;**As a result of these developments, we believe that if Elon Musk‚Äôs bid for Twitter disappeared tomorrow, Twitter‚Äôs equity would fall by 50% from current levels. Consequently, we see a significant risk that the deal gets repriced lower.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The key developments that have occurred since Musk‚Äôs initial stake include:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Nasdaq Has Plummeted \~17.6%, Implying A Twitter Price of \~$31.40 Per Share Without a Deal  
&gt;  
&gt;Musk‚Äôs disclosure of his initial Twitter position preceded a broad meltdown in tech stocks. As of this writing, the Nasdaq composite has plummeted \~17.6% since the closing price prior to Musk‚Äôs [disclosure](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001418091/f66f56c1-eb52-43f8-a7ff-992dc80a7396.pdf) of his initial 9.2% stake on April 4th.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Twitter Reported Weak Quarterly Results And Disclosed It Had Overstated Its Users (Again) Just 3 Days After Accepting Musk‚Äôs Offer, Suggesting Further Downside That Has Not Already Been Priced In, Should Musk Walk Away  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Musk Indicated He Will Sell His 9.2% Twitter Stake Should a Deal Not Consummate  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Is The $1 Billion Breakup Fee Really An Option To Walk Away? Yes, We Believe.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Public Square Should Rest on a Foundation of Financial Stability, Not Risky Leverage  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Board Has Virtually No Stake in Twitter. Key Holders Rolling Existing Equity or Contributing New Equity Would All Benefit From a Revised Deal  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Overpriced Twitter Deal Is Placing Undue Pressure on Tesla, Due to Equity Sales and The Prospect of More Margin Debt

As of Q1, they had 28 billion in assets on the books... 15 billion of that in straight cash. That means that right now the market is valuing this company at less than its assets.

Their burn rate is around 1B a quarter... IE they could not sell a single vehicle, not raise any capital, and operate for 5 years on their cash alone. They have an enormous financial cushion to draw on, not to mention the option to always go to Amazon for additional funding."

wallstreetbet,"Today in History: May 9th 1873 ‚Äì Der Krach: Vienna stock market crash heralds the Long Depression.The [Panic of 1873](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873) was a financial crisis that triggered an economic depression in Europe and North America that lasted from 1873 to 1877 or 1879 in France and in Britain. In Britain, the Panic started two decades of stagnation known as the ""Long Depression"" that weakened the country's economic leadership. In the United States, the Panic was known as the ""Great Depression"" until the events of 1929 and the early 1930s set a new standard. 

The Panic of 1873 and the subsequent depression had several underlying causes for which economic historians debate the relative importance. American inflation, rampant speculative investments (overwhelmingly in railroads), the demonetization of silver in Germany and the United States, ripples from economic dislocation in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), and major property losses in the Great Chicago Fire (1871) and the Great Boston Fire (1872) helped to place massive strain on bank reserves, which, in New York City, plummeted from $50 million to $17 million between September and October 1873.

The first symptoms of the crisis were financial failures in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary, which spread to most of Europe and to North America by 1873.

wallstreetbet,"I'm predicting CPI at 7.9% this weekUnpopular opinion: I think they'll announce CPI has dropped to 7.9% this week. 

Here's why: 
1) they lie. Numbers have been cooked for a long time, might as well make things look good on a midterm year. 


2) the CPI is a year-over-year number, so in the sliding 12-month window we're going to lose the change from March-April 2021, which was huge ( 1.6 ), and we're gaining the change from March-April 2021 (yet unknown), so as long as the cooked CPI formula reports a Delta smaller than the 1.6 from last March-April, the CPI number they report will go down.  Since the last few months have only gone up by 0.2-0.6 I feel pretty confident that with the 1.6 falling of the 12 month window will dominate the metric and the number will drop slightly

Another way to think about it is that since it's ""change in the last year"", this month has the advantage that inflation was already pretty bad last April, so they now get to use that already inflated period as the starting point.

wallstreetbet,"What should AMC do to become a better company? My open pitch to Adam Aron. A path AMC is likely unaware about and might fit their business model.AMC is in the business of showing movies. Obviously. Their goals are simple: once consumers come to the theaters, sell them on upcharges, and give them a pleasant enough experience to repeat the cycle.   


The flaw: They rely on others to drive traffic into their doors and the only growth avenue they have is buying more theaters.   


My suggestion: Audiobooks -&gt; Create Anime -&gt; Original Content to sell to the big producers after airing exclusive.   


Content is king. I happen to be embedded in the audiobook market. Do some quick research and you will see audiobooks are gaining in market share and revenue. The data varies, but you can see the annual revenue difference between audiobooks and movies is not too different.   


WSB: Okay Retard? Why are you talking about audiobooks?  
Me: You can buy the rights to an audio book for a few thousand dollars. You can do this and own the rights for a lifetime. I know this because I do this. Deploy your capital, buy audiobooks, give them as a reward for visiting the theater. Rent out a full listen on an app, do whatever, but you suddenly own something with a longer shelf life than a Tom Cruise movie.  


WSB: Great, that doesn't explain the anime nonsense. Feed me a banana to understand.  
ME: Glad you asked. You now purchased 1000 audiobooks. Stick them on the AMC app. You create a crowdsourced voting and funding platform that overlays on the app for that audiobook. If the title gains enough traction, or enough pledged funds, you produce the content. Anime over live reel to save costs. You can even award .25 cents for every movie ticket to apply to sync users to your app.   


WSB: Why would AMC want to produce content when others do it for them already?  
Me: Growth, Growth, and Growth. AMC's business model lacks expansion. If an anime show is paid for and you control the rights, why wouldn't you. The main thing here, is any of the giants can do this. Netflix, Amzon alread has with Vox Machina, and it really is an opportunity if you have the exposer. AMC has the exposure, capital, and capability. They can hire animation studios, only develop winners into big screen, and advance AMC from the sticky floor theater chain to a next generation powerhouse who not only sells seats, but creates content.     


I tried really hard to keep this simple for everyone. Is the concept perfect? No. I also tried to follow the rules with this post. I tagged it as a discussion to see what you guys think AMC should do. If I broke some rule let me know so I can ask my wife's boyfriend - Chad, really nice guy - to get the next one approved.   


Cheers, Marcus Sloss."

Everything from the impending war with Ukraine ( food shortages + energy shortages , all the way to the east with China‚Äôs real-estate bubble ( housing shortages ). There are major shortages of tons of products with inflation rapidly increasing ( a 40 year high in the united states ( fuck J.P. ) ). Asset/Product prices have been non-stop rising for two years (the price of everything has doubled) which were bought on extremely *low-interest* ( everything will get fucking margin called ). The 10YR 2YR has been cascading hard non stop since March of 2021. The PPI and CPI have almost exponentially grown since the pandemic. The price growth of everything is unsustainable for the long term. It all must level out, and it soon will.  


Doom is coming, we have months to prepare. As we all know, once something affects one part of the market, it affects the other causing a domino affect. But what kind of doom?

wallstreetbet,"How do people lose money on earnings play?I just saw a post saying it‚Äôs stupid to buy calls before earnings because of IV crush. This earnings season I made 17k profit off of 4k invested from a GOOGL $2840 2/11 call and a CMG $1550 2/25 call.

If you‚Äôre losing money on earnings play where you know a company will beat earnings, you‚Äôre seriously impatient and don‚Äôt know how to play high volatile market plays. Both of these calls I made sure had relatively low IV, the google call had an IV of around 40% and the CMG call had an IV of 60% (Ik this is relatively high but for earnings it‚Äôs actually pretty low). 

The key to my strategy which has worked super well is having excellent timing with your options for earnings. The google call was bought at 3:55 pm and the chipotle call was bought at 3:45 pm. Why? My philosophy is I want to minimize the other Greeks impact on options prices so I can capture as much gains from the high change in delta from after hours movement. By buying right before market close the day that they report earnings, I‚Äôm reducing the risk of time volatility (theta) impacting my calls or puts before the after hours movement. I always sell my calls the day after earnings report release at 9:30, regardless of gain or loss. This is because IV crush will always come the day after earnings, but if you sell at 9:30, IV is still high enough that you can capture most of the gains from the delta increase.

If you buy your calls/puts during the day of earnings planning to swing trade them after the after hours movement, you‚Äôre seriously retarded. You‚Äôre just letting your option lose value throughout the day, cause let‚Äôs be honest for earnings you want to buy week out or two week out options, due to theta. Sure, you can scalp a little extra profit if you buy at the low for the day, but it‚Äôs not worth the risk.

I swear if you follow this strategy of buying a two week out ATM or slightly OTM call at 3:55 and sell at 9:30, you can‚Äôt lose unless you pick the wrong direction.

The whole point of earnings is to capture the AH gains that change your option price enough that delta offsets the decrease in vega. By trading only for about 5 mins of market hours, you‚Äôre limiting theta‚Äôs effect on decreasing the gains from delta. I honestly don‚Äôt get how you retards can lose following this strategy. Shit I‚Äôve made a third of my salary following this strategy.

TLDR: buy your options for earnings ATM or slightly OTM with a week or two for expiry and sell at 9:30 the next gain to always win if you get the right direction.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Buy Nvidia calls with 2 weeks expiry at 3:55 and sell at 9:30 and I guarantee you at least 50% gains.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you have been smoking weed since you were in your mothers' wombs. I'm sure many of you are high right now. I think this stock has **BIG** potential to be a **giant** in the cannabis scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get into the details: 

&amp;#x200B;

JIZZ PHARMA ($JAZZ) is a pharma company that acquired GW Pharma in early 2021. GW Pharma had a **FUCKTON** of patents on **compounds from cannabis to treat various diseases. THOSE NOW BELONG TO JAZZ PHARMA.** Let's take a look at their pipeline:   


[WEED AT EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.](https://preview.redd.it/581pqo6l1ph81.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56655671b3f0efed61e8594f4103304a08045f3f)

You see that fucktards?? **THEY MIGHT CURE YOUR AUTISM WITH WEED.** 

&amp;#x200B;

THEY'LL CURE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE CURED WITH WEED.

&amp;#x200B;

The FDA recently launched their [Cannabis Derived Products Data Acceleration Plan ](https://www.fda.gov/media/153183/download). This plan was created because a bunch of the tards over at r/altcannabinoids were boofing all these random unstudied compounds from weed (CBG, CBDA, THCV, THCP) and reporting how it helps with \[insert random shit here\].

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6gesjq03ph81.png?width=1898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ddac2296f0492f4856052610655514257393cc4

 It looks like their reports might hold some weight if the motherfucking FDA is looking at it. Guess who owns the patents on a lot of this shit? **MOTHERFUCKING JIZZ PHARMA.**

**Conclusion**

They have earnings calls on 2/22. I'm holding this shit for a while. This is the company that makes money off of weed as medicine. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Thursday, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine ‚Äî a research and advocacy nonprofit with more than 17,000 doctor members ‚Äî filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture against the University of California, Davis regarding ‚Äúdeadly monkey experiments‚Äù performed at Neuralink.

According to the committee, UC Davis received more than $1.4 million from Neuralink to carry out the experiments.

In the complaint, which is based on more than 500 pages of ‚Äúdisturbing documents,‚Äù PCRM noted that UC Davis and Neuralink staff didn‚Äôt provide adequate care to dying monkeys, and also used an unapproved substance in the experiments.

The substance, Bioglue, allegedly killed the macaque monkeys used in the experiment by destroying portions of their brains.

‚ÄúUC Davis may have handed over its publicly-funded facilities to a billionaire, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can evade transparency requirements and violate federal animal welfare laws,‚Äù Jeremy Beckham, the committee‚Äôs research advocacy coordinator said in a statement

 

‚ÄúThe documents reveal that monkeys had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to suffer and die. It‚Äôs no mystery why Elon Musk and the university want to keep photos and videos of this horrific abuse hidden from the public,‚Äù Beckham added.

According to the complaint, at least 23 rhesus macaque monkeys were used in the project, titled ‚ÄúDevelopment of a Large-Scale Brain-Machine Interface in Rhesus Macaques.‚Äù

Some of them experienced ‚Äúmultiple major survival surgical procedures‚Äù in which electrodes were implanted into the brains of at least 10 animals.

The monkeys also underwent ‚Äúhead fixation,‚Äù when researchers allegedly used either a head-post implant or what the lab referred to as ‚Äúpillows‚Äù to keep the animal‚Äôs head immobile during periods of ‚Äúprolonged restraint.‚Äù

Some of the monkeys were restrained to a chair for up to five hours per day, the committee alleges. Some of them also underwent fatal procedures, including a ‚Äúdevice explant.‚Äù

According to the complaint, which was reviewed by the Daily News, one 11-year-old monkey ‚Äúwas killed‚Äù in July 2018. Prior to ‚Äúbeing used in this fatal procedure,‚Äù records indicated that the monkey had been on antidepressants and had chronic diarrhea and poor appetite.

Another 11-year-old monkey who ‚Äúwas killed in a terminal procedure‚Äù in March 2019, had been subject to a cranial implant that had been surgically placed inside the animal‚Äôs brain about three months earlier.

In October 2018, UC Davis staff noted that the monkey was ‚Äúmissing multiple digits \[on\] both hands, \[right\] foot,‚Äù possibly from self-mutilation or some other unspecified trauma.

The committee says that UC Davis has refused to release photos and videos of the experiments, claiming that the records belong to Neuralink, a private company not subject to California‚Äôs Public Records Act.

PCRM argues that work that has been conducted in public facilities is subject to the California Public Records Act and, as such, must be disclosed.

‚ÄúUC Davis cannot shield a private company from public scrutiny,‚Äù said Deborah Dubow Press, an attorney with the Physicians Committee. ‚ÄúPhotos and videos of animals housed and experimented on in a public institution are public records. Neuralink can‚Äôt avail itself of public resources but evade public accountability,‚Äù she added.

Neuralink was founded in 2016 by the Tesla titan and a group of experts in areas such as neuroscience, biochemistry and robotics.

According to a description on its website, the company‚Äôs ‚Äúteam of exceptionally talented people‚Äù is working to create ‚Äúthe future of brain interfaces: building devices now that will help people with paralysis and inventing new technologies that will expand our abilities, our community, and our world.‚Äù"

wallstreetbet,"Moderna CEO Dumps Stock and Deletes Twitter Account$MRNA CEO, Stephen Bancel, recently deleted his Twitter account. Over the past 2 years he has sold over $400 million on stock. We will look at MRNAs price over the last 5 years, insider selling over this time period, and what a deleted Twitter account might indicate.

## [MRNA](https://utradea.com/stocks/MRNA) Price Performance

Comparing the current price relative to MRNA's 52 week high of $497.49, we see that MRNA is currently trading 67.6 % lower than the 52 week high price.

In mid 2019, MRNA was trading around $20 per share. In the middle of 2021 it reached an all time high of almost $500 per share. This is a 25x increase in share price, which is significant. This is important to note because until the pandemic hit, Stephen had not sold any of his shares.

### MRNA CEO - Stephen Bancel

Here is a quick snippet of Stephen‚Äôs corporate profile. He has been with Moderna for over 10 years.

*St√©phane Bancel has served as Moderna's Chief Executive Officer since October 2011 and as a member of Moderna‚Äôs board of directors since March 2011. Before joining the Company, Mr. Bancel served for five years as Chief Executive Officer of the French diagnostics company bioM√©rieux SA. From July 2000 to March 2006, he served in various roles at Eli Lilly and Company, including as Managing Director, Belgium and as Executive Director, Global Manufacturing Strategy and Supply Chain. Prior to Lilly, Mr. Bancel served as Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Director for bioM√©rieux.*

### MRNA CEO - Insider Trading History

Over the last 5 years Stephen has not purchased any shares of Moderna. Typically, we see CEOs and members of the executive leadership team purchase shares of their own company if they believe it is a strong investment.

The chart below shows that in the last 2 year, Stephen sold shares on almost a weekly basis.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4i18o5l29oh81.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d9a3754e4cab3d7853b2e2182db62f59297e7a

If we look at the 5-year chart and performance of MRNA we see that the pandemic has been very profitable for Moderna.

One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, was noted as saying that ""insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.‚Äù

I think this quote is pretty telling. The executive team doesn‚Äôt thin MRNA will reach these highs again, since a majority of their revenue came from COVID-19 vaccines.

### MRNA CEO Deletes Twitter Account

On February 8, 2022 Stephen deleted his Twitter account. Here is a [link](https://twitter.com/sbancel) to his deleted account

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ouirah39oh81.png?width=337&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c188e51cce46c012443bc88d3078848b574fa72

There are several reasons why someone would delete their account. We‚Äôve seen in the past people get called put for incorrect or inappropriate tweets. This could be one of the reasons. I think the other main reasons is that Tweets can be used in a court of law, and if Stephen is facing upcoming litigation he might have been instructed by his legal counsel to delete his account and historical tweets.

### MRNA Upcoming Litigation?

Moderna CEO warns people may need fourth Covid shot as efficacy of boosters likely to decline over time ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/moderna-ceo-says-people-may-need-fourth-covid-shot-as-efficacy-of-boosters-likely-to-decline-over-time.html))

* Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the efficacy of boosters against Covid-19 will likely decline over time, and some people may need a fourth shot by the fall.
* ‚ÄúI would expect that it‚Äôs not going to hold great,‚Äù Bancel said, during a Goldman Sachs interview, referring to the strength of the single booster shots.
* A random mutation could change the course of the pandemic again, Bancel warned.

### Why Delete Your Twitter Account and Sell Shares?

I think it‚Äôs self evident. There are two main reasons why Stephen deleted his twitter account and has been selling his shares over the past year.

1. He knows Moderna valuation will never be as high as it was during the peak of the pandemic. It was an opportune time to capitalize on the all-time high share price.
2. His deleted account is likely in response to the effectiveness of the clinical trials for Moderna and new vaccines entering the market.

We won‚Äôt know for sure why he deleted his account, and a lot of it is speculation. The selling of shares over the last 2 years makes sense, and we‚Äôve seen several other CEOs and executives sell their shares when their share prices hit all-time highs. I think we will start to new additional news and reports about Moderna over the coming weeks which will provide a more concrete reason to why Stephen deleted his Twitter account."

I'm trying to get a an idea of who the major players are, where they currently are in their development and what investment opportunities might come up. I'm a complete amateur, but I took the time to compile this list of quantum companies as well as do a little research into what each one is doing. I posted my DD on IonQ months before it pumped to $30 when it was around $7.50 post spac merger. I aim to replicate these results by continuing to pay attention to this brand new sector. This isn't' investment advice, I just figured I could share some of the work I've done and hopefully it helps someone out.

They currently have a 32 qubit system operating on Amazon Braket, google business suite, and Microsoft quantum servers. Hey have made significant progress with error correction and have recently been able to adjust the starting material for their trapped ions, switching from Ytterbium to Barium for their trapped ions, and building their primary chips from glass instead of silicon. They have major partnerships with Hyundai and Goldman Sachs developing in house systems for quantum data collection. For Hyundai, they hope to simulate battery development to build better electric car power sources, they really have an advantageous position being so early and able to work currently with interested parties. Their road map suggests lower qubit counts than other competitors but that doesn't represent the error correction, fidelity, and multi core capabilities of their systems. Their plan to develop a rack mountable ion array is on track for 2024. Sound and cooling prove to still be an issue but trapped ions have been proven to be able to run at room temperature, albeit they were very small systems and they under performed compared to identical systems with increased cooling. Ionq is better positioned that most people realize and if their error correction and scaling physical qubit counts keep rising, they should be considered the best current option to the public right now for running real quantum operations despite that quantum supremacy isn't achieved yet.

If they can solve noise and cooling issues, they should be an eventual industry leader. Honeywell recently split them off into a separate divisions with 300m in initial investment. They have compiled all of their quantum computing patents and development into this new quantum solutions lab.

DWAVE ‚Äì¬†Dwave just recently announced that they are going public through a spac merger with XPOA. They have had significant progress with fundraising and have a unique computer with quantum annealing capability. Essentially through gradual cooling of their qubit arrays, they can solve problems related to energy minimization. Right now they are far behind the speed of conventional computers but appear to eventually be able to clearly simulate energy systems much better than any super computer. Primarily it will be used by placing the qubits at an energy minimum, from there the hardware alters the configuration so the energy landscape reflects the problem that needs to be addressed. Ideally all the qubits end up with the lowest possible energy of that landscape, identifying the lowest energy state. If the result shows something else, like another problem so that it looks like energy minimization, then the final state will represent a solution to that problem. Any problem with need of energy minimization such as travel/shipping logistics, workflow optimizations, traveling sales merchants, etc, all of those data sets can be applied in an energy landscape. Conventional computers can do great with smaller scale problems, Dwave hopes to be able to solve complex energy optimization and resource allocation issues. There is no merger date but Dwave intends to complete a spac merger with XPOA.

Conclusion:

In the simplest way possible, traditional computers use bits, quantum computers use qubits. It takes special environmental conditions to create qubits. You cant have 100% contained qubits because then you couldn't interact and manipulate them. So you have open systems, with say 93% accurate qubits systems with 7% required error correction. You focus on replicating that, increasing fidelity, then using those physical qubits to create ‚Äúdigital‚Äù qubits with say 98% accuracy and 2% required error correction. Ideally, one more level of simulation and you can create 100% accurate qubit systems that should be able simulate anything regarding quantum mechanics. What we really want to see is this,


1. The Primary goal of every single hardware company here is to first work on error correction and create fidelity.

2. The next step would be to demonstrate that the error correction is getting better as the qubit count increases, exponentially so. This also relates to leaps in quantum volume.

3. Then demonstrate the creation of an error corrected logical qubit with endless coherency.

4. Demonstrate the ability to make 2x logical qubit systems with 2x logical qubit operations.

5. Thread and Tile thousands of logical qubits proving the technology would have vast quantum supremacy over conventional Supercomputers. Revolutionizing computational power and cryptography.


Some of these companies, especially the research institutes may utilize various methods of quantum computing. Just because they are in a specific section doesn't preclude them from others methods. Most companies don't even report their qubit numbers and definitely not fidelity rates. Mostly right now its a race for error correction and patents. We have quantum volume as a measuring tool, but eventually that will need to be replaced because the data for the quantum volume is processed using conventional computers. Eventually they wont be able to system check. I expect for some of these companies to have breakthroughs and when certain prototypes prove effective, maybe with Goldman Sachs partnership with IONQ for instance, more and more news will start flowing. I think every company, as long as they progress and earn some patents will eventually succeed or be bought out by a bigger player. Hope that this surface info helps you understand what to look for when you see the news and just how many companies there already are trying to get in the game.

wallstreetbet,"Stock is the only place to surviveAll this market self-off due to fed hike is bullshit. You have to look at the inflation. 7.5%. And that‚Äôs minimum i believe. Have you checked House prices or gas prices or potato prices?! Fcking double digit! So what do you do? You are not big fat rich neighbour of your cousin who can diversify into gold, or bonds which will fall as rates go up. You are stuck either with cash or stocks. Ray Dalio says Cash is trash( if you dont know who Ray D is you deserve to be in this sub) and I agree with him. You are basically down 7.5% minimum by staying in cash. So you buy stocks (not options, stocks). So what do you buy? You buy companies which can survive high inflation, rising rate hike. Bank stocks (they go up when rates do) , energy (oil is in high demand , fuck ESG investors and climate change advocates, oil is not going anywhere neither gas) there is more demand to oil and gas than to Viagra. Then you buy STRONG BALANCE SHEET tech companies who have been oversold but will likely keep going up - Facebook, Twitter , Google. Then you look at where supply chain issues have created a demand- Chips, graphics card. Nvidia, Amd may be few cents to drop on Intel. 

Tldr : buy financials, energy, oversold strong balance sheet tech stocks. (Reminder again:Not options, stocks)

Zillow‚Äôs unusually bad timing for buying homes in an attempt to flip them.

[Q2 - 3,142 homes in inventory ](https://preview.redd.it/a9aeh5ssilh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=888160ddd4a494c06f95601d58cfea23a7955cdf)

Zillow continues to aggressively purchase homes so it must be churning a profit‚Ä¶.right? Well lets see!

[Q2 ‚Äì 2,086 Homes sold, averaging $19,636 per home](https://preview.redd.it/cj3vvjy3jlh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81564fc51205dde85d7c268258df3a636b2fa8c7)

[Q3 ‚Äì 3,032 Homes sold, averaging $7,081 per home. Wait what just happened? More homes are being sold and we are making less money? Zillow is still asleep at the wheel.](https://preview.redd.it/k2b5f8e5jlh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55b1dbc430546ae5a474e73c0e3cf926ab985216)

[Q4 ‚Äì 8,353 Homes sold, averaging -$27,609 per home. Perhaps Zillow isn‚Äôt asleep at the wheel but rather closed its eyes and decided to YOLO it WSB style. It was doing poorly attempting to sell 3,000 homes. Let‚Äôs double down, no, no, let's TRIPLE our inventory of dog shit wrapped in cat shit so we have even more shit by the end of Q3 so we lose more money by Q4](https://preview.redd.it/j7qgng3bjlh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2103e6699f4cf35dbc9500a1539861b99598326)

If anyone is to be a mod on WSB it should be whoever approved Zillow‚Äôs game plan for purchasing homes during such a volatile and unpredictable time. 

# Thesis

Q3 should have been a massive red flag for Zillow. 50% increase in home sales, with a 50% decline in returns compared to Q2. How this wasn‚Äôt caught earlier on is beyond me. Zillow still doesn‚Äôt seem to know what kind of a ride it‚Äôs in for. Q4 results with forward guidance were very optimistic and seemed to downplay the very serious issue of its current inventory. 2021 created a very volatile period for housing with aggressive buyers willing to place bids significantly over asking price. Zillow played into this game purchasing homes at overvalued prices outbidding others. A direct quote from the Q4 shareholder letter:

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made significant progress in our efforts to wind down our iBuying business ‚Äî selling homes faster than we anticipated at better unit economics than we projected. The wind-down process is running smoothly and efficiently, and we expect it to generate positive cash flow. We feel even more confident today that exiting iBuying and eliminating the housing market balance sheet risk to our company and our shareholders was the right decision. We remain focused on continuing to grow our core businesses as we deliver innovative new ways to help our customers move.‚Äù*

A very quick change of attitude from just 3 months ago in the Q3 shareholder letter: 

*‚ÄúBecause of this price forecasting volatility, we have had to reconsider what the business might look like at a larger size. We have offered sellers a fair market price from the start of Zillow Offers, while also being clear that the business would only become consistently profitable at scale. We have determined this large scale would require too much equity capital, create too much volatility in our earnings and balance sheet, and ultimately result in far lower return on equity than we imagined. This home price forecasting volatility has also contributed to significant capacity and demand planning challenges, exacerbated by a difficult labor and supply chain environment, leading to our announcement 1 two weeks ago to suspend signing new contracts through the end of this year. We judge future significant volume volatility to be an impediment to ramp a scaled operation, and any interruptions in the supply chain like we‚Äôve recently experienced could result in increased holding times, further increasing our exposure to volatility‚Äù*

Zillow recognized its mistakes in Q3, and downplayed them or even avoided addressing the real issues at hand in Q4 in an attempt to please investors, and it worked. 

 

[Median days on market increasing by the month.](https://preview.redd.it/pxyf88ynklh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b3b09b875fcbad05203a5b706411f17ed08f4c)

[Number of home sales dropping](https://preview.redd.it/rhjphizpklh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=565ae0dd0270b0d5c20915480f1ef800dd929178)

&amp;#x200B;

[Active listings quickly dropping](https://preview.redd.it/hyux7rasklh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31d1f0417d1120c17b666f6a54d3bbeba73bf24f)

&amp;#x200B;

[Median sales prices declining‚Ä¶slowly for now](https://preview.redd.it/m4n0zsutklh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac6921a043ea9d2ed337a508b9b679e9143dbd5)

So how is Zillow planning on getting rid of over 10,000 homes in a hurry AND provide positive cash flow when there are fewer buyers, fewer sellers, and homes are stuck on the market for longer. The 8,000 homes sold in Q4 brought negative returns of about 7%. The overpriced homes purchased in Q3 at the pinnacle of the housing market paired with incoming rising rates and significant drop in home prices is bound to have drastic effects on future earnings and balance sheets as time goes on. Current home prices are in a downtrend but appear to be flatlined due to a lack of homes of being sold on the market. There is no demand or supply keeping the price steady where it is. An influx of homes on the market will send home prices into a downward spiral.

Let‚Äôs take a quick look to see if overbidding is occurring in homes sold in Q2-Q3 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/vbqlxcwbmlh81.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d11f787f26c26037be5cb5d58fb0111090deae5

[SURPRISE! Don‚Äôt worry Zillow, you‚Äôre not in this alone.](https://preview.redd.it/7zsiau0emlh81.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f5aa6b451fca8d60e1f7f0489daf53225db12d9)

[Here is someone who, like Zillow, overbid for a home trying to flip it for a quick profit. Sold it for an 11&amp;#37; loss by end of Q4. Sound familiar?](https://preview.redd.it/rj43fhgjmlh81.png?width=438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7187750a92e62fc97c9b46400e7895732cbc1445)

How does Zillow with access to all this information go ahead and make the decision to scale their house flipping business is a question I believe not even they can answer.

TL;DR ‚Äì If you‚Äôre actually a member of WSB this is where you stop scrolling and start reading. Zillow is currently carrying a large high-risk portfolio of homes which will be difficult to unload contrary to the Q4 forward guidance issued by Zillow. The steps taken by Zillow to minimize the impact of is horrendous home purchasing policy such as firing employees and shutting down the home purchase program came far too late into game. All sectors of Zillow‚Äôs revenue stream will be hurt from the sudden drop in house sales and buyers.

wallstreetbet,"Here is how Ukraine invasion will go down (DD)Here is a brief DD on how Ukraine invasion will go down, I'm offering my opinion as veteran of WSB and expert in these things.

The official ""invasion"" will be done super quickly from within by FSB/SVR agents who've been living in Ukraine for years/decades just for this purpose, take control of strategic points , communications and government, then ground forces join them with blitzkrieg tank convoys, with air force destroying weapons, tanks and airfields.

Russian Air Force is like orders of magnitude larger and stronger than Ukraine's, and can be all over the place in 20 minutes not sure why everyone is worried about ground troops.

They will probably try really hard to minimize civilian casualties as it would tarnish the ""one people"" narrative. But if these happen they will blame it on ""separatists"" and ""Nato operatives"".

NATO will just stand on the side and nervously smoke a blunt or in case of the US a free crack pipe

 -Funds and Institutions need to unwind the leverage they have been building for 2 YEARS meaning they have to sell assets to cover their margins IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT THE STOCK PRICE IS THEY MUST SELL ASSETS TO COVER DEBT 

 -As asset prices come down stop losses will be hit forcing more margin covering and forced selling will cascade into a bigger correction

-ASSET PRICES HAVE BEEN OVERBOUGHT FOR 2 YEARS BECAUSE OF LOW INTEREST RATES (FREE MONEY) 

-TINA(THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE)(WELL NO THERE IS) as fixed income returns a higher yield money comes out of risky assets and goes into risk off assets

EQT Corporation operates as a natural gas production company in the United States. The company produces natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, and natural gasoline.

Currently, they are the number 1 LNG producer in the US and have had numerous increases in price targets that range from $47-$64.

When Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time back in 2014, EQT almost broke $60.00:

wallstreetbet,"New form of govermentI just wanted to know your opinion on my proposal for a state system.

 What if our state were run like a corporation and every single citizen is a shareholder of the state.  As with a corporation, each tax expense would need to be publicly available and each shareholder would need to be able to see income/expenses, investments, etc transparently.  The aim of this state must then be to increase democratically determined values.  Instead of only being profit-oriented, other values ‚Äã‚Äãcould then be taken as a goal, e.g.

 quality of life and health-adjusted life expectancy,

 happiness/well-being and mental health,

 environmental quality,

 affordability of living standards,

 childhood success rates,

 Underemployment,

 income inequality,

 consumer and student debt,

 level of work and civic engagement,

 Voluntary work,

 infant mortality,

 infrastructure quality,

 access to education,

 marriage and divorce rates,

 substance abuse and related deaths,

 national optimism,

 Personal Dynamics/Economic Mobility,

 The shareholders (population) would then rate the board (government) on the achievements they had made during their tenure and either retain it or replace it if no progress was seen on those points.  It would also have the advantage of allocating the capital (taxes) as efficiently as possible to meet these goals.  Of course, unlike in a corporation, you cannot sell your share in the state and every citizen has an equal share.

 What do you think?"

Current market/ economic conditions will make raising cash for these small/ micro caps difficult so it‚Äôs likely we see more M&amp;A occur in the future and there is opportunity there to make profits for anyone that buys in prior to any announcements. 

I understand the point of the market cap rule is to prevent p&amp;d‚Äôs but any investment into possible targets would not be short dated calls or buying shares to pump the price short term as we would have no clue on the actual dates and any investment would be a longer term buy n hold shares or leap calls and wait for announcement?"

They just moved their earnings date back a few weeks so that they can process recent human trials data as part of the news release, but the market has dipped on reactionary fear creating a buying opportunity in the $3 range.

Rockley's temperature sensor is more accurate than any other thermometers, which is why the expectation is that it will be in the Apple Watch in September this year.

The market will fall, zombie companies will die and unemployment will go up. But at the same time the Dollar would beome strong, DXY will go up. And Inflation would maybe get curved albeit not a lot but still it would be better than what we have now. 

OR 

Markets Goes down b/c of Fed's policy and Jerome backs off with leaving the interest rates alone and may be more QE to inflate the market again. In this scenario the inflation turns into Hyperinflation and commodities will sky rocket.

wallstreetbet,"Buffet‚Äôs Analysis of Geico in 1951- Why was it attractive then?Here is a look into the mind of Buffet when he was just 21.  He was still a student at the University of Columbia embracing the teachings of Benjamin Graham.

In 1951, as Geico was one of its key holdings of Graham (Graham is also Chairman of the Board), Buffet would want to know more about the company. 

He took a train down to Washington on a Saturday where the Geico office was closed. He was persistent enough to get the building janitor to lead him to Lorimer Davidson who was the only one working that day. Davidson would eventually be the CEO in 1958.

The encounter gave him a huge head start in the business of insurance that would be one of the key foundations for his future investment framework. Free float in the form of premiums if successfully invested would unleash the power of compounding.

Buffet came up with the thesis of investing in Geico after the meeting and have it published.

wallstreetbet,"$ICNBIconic Brands, Inc. - $ICNB

Company Profile
Iconic Brands Inc is a United States-based company engaged in the development, marketing and distribution of celebrity-branded alcohol beverages. Its activities include the development and completion of product idea, sourcing, flavor profiles, packaging, design, marketing, and distribution. The company's product portfolio comprises of Bellissima Prosecco; Bella Sprizz Apertifs; BiVi Vodka and Hooters Spirits

Main Revenue Driver 
Iconic Brands acquired TopPop Packaging in 2021. 

TopPop Packaging is a premier contract manufacturing and packaging company, specializing in single use flexible packaging applications in the food beverage, and health categories.


Why this matters 

Iconic Brands, and their CEO Larry Romer (Former Jim Beam VP, southern wine and spirits VP, and Coca Cola senior management) thinks that Ready to Drink (think Margaritas/Shots/etc. to go) and Ready to Freeze (popsicles) alcoholic beverages are the best big thing in the alcohol industry, as its the next natural progression of the beverage industry after seltzers made their big debuts in 2020/2021. Top Pop's biggest customer is Anhueser-Busch, in which TopPop packages their Bud Light Seltzer Ice Popsicles, which are sure to be a hit in summer of 2022. This is just a glimpse at the wide array of packaging products TopPop does, and they're currently running their two facilities at max capacity 24/7 to keep up with demand. Their annual report should be released soon, in which we can expect record breaking revenues from Iconic Brands. 

Third Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights

    Total revenue of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $2.1 million or approximately 300% year-over-year, compared to $712,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

    Gross profit was $695,000, an increase of 57% year-over-year as compared to gross profit for the same period in 2020.

    Strong balance sheet with ~55 million in total assets.


This is surely a stock that has solid fundamentals and has the products and management team to take this company to the next level."

**Equity Index Rotation**

This is pretty much a classic 60/40 portfolio with a twist. This symphony looks at the 5-day cumulative return for the major US indices and selects the one with the best performance. The strategy rotates among the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the industrial-led Dow, and the balanced S&amp;P 500.

**Defense**

What I like the most about this strategy is the minimum volatility, quality, and yield factors. Ideal if the current macroeconomic situation is to further deteriorate.

**Paired Switching Dow and Bonds**

This strategy switches from holding the Dow to short-term US government bonds if the Dow has a dip. Then back again to the Dow until the next dip.

* Pricing makes assets vulnerable to deterioration, Goldman says
* Stoxx 600 has almost erased losses since Russia‚Äôs invasion

&gt;Global markets may be getting too relaxed about downside risks related to war in Ukraine, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said, warning that current prices no longer reflect more negative scenarios.  
&gt;  
&gt;The recent outperformance of European assets and a reversal of sharp gains for oil prices ‚Äúpoints to a significant relaxation in the market‚Äôs assessment of the global implications‚Äù of the invasion, strategists Dominic Wilson and Vickie Chang wrote in a note. Assets are now ‚Äúmore vulnerable if progress toward a resolution proves fleeting or if energy supplies are disrupted more severely.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe‚Äôs benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index is close to erasing all of the losses sustained since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, while the S&amp;P 500 is now trading higher than where it closed on the eve of the attack.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under Goldman‚Äôs downside scenario, a severe disruption in gas flows from Russia could shave off 2.5 percentage points from European gross domestic product and 0.25 points from U.S. economic output this year. According to the strategists, a deterioration of the conflict could push the S&amp;P 500 to 4,059 index points -- a drop of almost 8% from Thursday‚Äôs close.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúOur downside case is no longer well reflected in many areas and it is now easier to identify potential hedges than it has been for several weeks,‚Äù the strategists said. Adjusting for options volatility, long oil positions stand out, while European assets now screen more favorably too as downside tail hedges, they said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Highlighting the contrast between sanguine markets and risks from the conflict, the [U.S yesterday warned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-17/putin-is-likely-to-make-nuclear-threats-if-war-drags-u-s-says) that Russian President Vladimir Putin may go as far as threatening to use nuclear weapons if stiff Ukrainian resistance to Russia‚Äôs invasion continues. Europe‚Äôs Stoxx 600 opened little changed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Barclays Plc strategist Emmanuel Cau agrees with Goldman. ‚ÄúMore substantial progress may be needed for the risk-on move to persist,‚Äù he wrote in a note to clients. ‚ÄúEven if a truce were to happen soon, it is unclear whether sanctions on Russia will be lifted immediately. So the negative impact on growth and higher inflation will still materialize.‚Äù

By [Nikos Chrysoloras](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ARxVfCWkfNk/nikos-chrysoloras)

wallstreetbet,"WHY did markets dip at 2PM then at 2:30PM it rallied on Federal Reserve Day?&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/00suzqiv45o81.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd542fe4c44f2b07b1eb631e5cf43404d6cd65a3

Hello everyone! During Federal Reserve Day (this Wednesday), markets at open were +2% positive, and climbed to over 3% (NASDAQ). However, at 2PM on the dot, markets were still +1.5% or so, but dropped dramatically to below the open (ie wiped out nearly 3% of gains in the morning).

At 2:30PM, when Powell started talking, markets again rallied closing extremely positive. It's been bugging me for ages, so I myself have a few theories:

* Markets priced in 7 rate hikes this year upt to around 200 basis points from 25. The FOMC's dot plot (also released 2PM) showed a median of 1.875%, with the effective rate being 200 basis points. HOWEVER, the MEAN / variance seems to be highly elevated. In fact, the mean is 2.046875%, and the median is 1.875%. Could it be that the dot plot essentially was ""worse than expected?"" Ie the mean's extra of 0.05% was not within expectations ie a possible rate increase of 50 points (although that'll make it 2.25%) is possible this year in 1 meeting? Could this be the reason behind the drop? 

https://preview.redd.it/o7qejtxh75o81.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf0d07b4a8cb85e456b51920cf5a045d64eca91b

* Markets rallied at the morning due to possible peace talks. This is a mostly known event by most people. Markets did dip to +2% or so, which is what's generally supposed to happen pre FOMC. The 2PM dip is a forced drop since +3% was extremely far away from the hourly 20 SMA, thus it must drop to the 20 SMA for any further rise.
* Since everyone was in a ""good mood"" that day, people sold after the 2PM FOMC statement, since it was within expectations, causing stop losses to get eaten. It continued going south until 2:36PM (B) The conference ([https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20220316.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20220316.htm)) started at 2:30PM (A). I re-watched the video, and at the 6 minute mark (B), Powell talks about how markets are very important, and how they don't want to add uncertainty in already very uncertain and challenging times. At (B) 2:37PM, Powell says the US economy is very strong, and can handle tighter monetary policy. (B) also starts questions. (C) 2:38PM Jeanna from NYT asks about recession probabilities. Powell in (C) and (D) says the chance is super low, and so on. You can see the consecutive green bars. But this does NOT explain why the continuous drops.

https://preview.redd.it/i4rxr5fo45o81.png?width=1271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e81dc8d6e551a83794fd4460f66355c6bde1f25

* Could people already know that people know it's within expectations, thus at 2PM, markets ""fake"" sell causing people to think the FOMC was worse than expected, causing it to further drop drop drop. Then when people sold, people ate all the cheap sold stock.
* Could this be the ""buy the rumour, sell the news?"" scenario to play on people's psychology?

There are two goals here: (1) giving more visibility on Congress violating the STOCK Act and (2) give everyone insight into what the ""Insiders"" are trading. 

There are a few things to note:  
 

* I can only post transactions as they are disclosed, which could be a few days or some even as much as 45 days old (if they are following the law).
* I recently added the House of Representatives which do WAY more transactions since there are 435 (vs 100 Senators) of them so I'm thinking things could get messy if there are 30+ transactions per day (or more!). Maybe consolidating them would be a good idea in the future.

wallstreetbet,"American Oil DRIPS Underneath While Buffet Profits.    Doing my research I feel confident that with everything going on regarding more heavy minded tensions regarding war and increased prices, prices will tighten at the 100$ a barrel and then just as everyone thinks oils headed to 150 or 160 it drops to a permanent 90, 80, high 70‚Äôs into a hopeful 60‚Äôs coming into 2023.

  it is not only an increase to the economical situation Covid brought but a way to boost economies on a global scale. Regarding Biden, I feel a poorly handed pandemic, war, increase in prices, taxes and rates across the board is a terrible look. With my research done, I discovered Oil companies based in the U.S. have stockpiled hundreds of permits prior to Biden becoming president. 
    
  With all the insider garbage, lies and disregard for basic decency oil is at a point of, okay, this is where it‚Äôs at. The Limbo Affect that war has especially a war so heavily revolved around oil and natural resources brings note to new highs and new high lows. 

 Basically here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking. 

   As resources from food to water to housing to oil have their moment to shine in the economy, they are based in a timely fashion. Warren Buffett the gayest man alive, has taken a massive position in an American oil company. What do I think this means? 

  Once oil reaches a point of semi permanent ‚Äúthis is where we‚Äôre at‚Äù the tides will suddenly change and America will begin producing oil out of its ass and getting help from neighbors, suddenly gas prices change, crude oil drops and the majority of crayon eaters are left eating the box while the rich stay rich. 

Instead of investing into oil cus manipulation is rampant and I can‚Äôt do options to save my life in this bear market, I believe DRIP has more in store for us yet again. 

Positions: 500 shares of DRIP at 2.82

DRIP has a reverse split of 10-1 coming into affect on March 28th, reverse splits often bring fear but they also bring growth. Doing the math, it is set up beautifully with American oil companies sweeping the rug under most investors feet and will perform extraordinarily as energy and oil stocks go back and forth, this would be the middle play. 

In Simple Terms

 Buy Drip on the Dip as it prepares to split 
               Profit off the growth 
           Buy more Drip with profit
Post split experiences massive growth as American Oil takes over in the upcoming months, take final profit and move on with gains

wallstreetbet,"Bottom may or may not be inFor many reasons, I think this recent pull back from ATH (just over -20%) is over. CQQQ bottomed and was oversold even on the monthly and weekly time frames as the Chinese market saw major capitulation and an impressive initial bounce, not too dissimilar from the 2008-9 bottom. QQQ SPY and many major stocks were/are all over sold on the longer time frames, and it‚Äôs March. Check out March of 2020 and 2009, tax season, perfect time for there to be a rally, but that‚Äôs more of a coincidence. That said I‚Äôm still prepared for the possibility of a dead cat bounce as we still haven‚Äôt gotten technical confirmation, technically. 

REGARDLESS, here‚Äôs my question:

IF this is the bottom of the pull back and we begin a rally here to potentially new ATHs, I want to take the utmost advantage of this opportunity. 

1) which sector/industry and which specific stocks do you think will have the biggest recovery IF this is the end of the pull back (and why)?

2) what‚Äôs the best way to act on that belief to maximise returns, ie, scaling into leaps or swing trades? Please do share your strategy

I and many others among us appreciate you taking the time to type out your thoughtful insights. 

Cheers and good luck brethren"

What I do know is that removing a nuclear superpower from SWIFT is a big move. And that every move after is a bet on what way the wind blows after. Major banking firms, Microsoft, Oracle...they made a decision between weathering the storm and a few months of bad publicity and leaving a lot of cash and gear on the table, or cutting out and dealing with what comes next.

Simply put, even if I don't know the minutae, I know that you don't make a move without reading the analysis and deciding it's worth your time. Deciding that the goodwill, public feedback, government interaction, whatever, is worth it. 

The Pinto didn't stay on the market because Ford was cheap. It stayed their because the cost wasn't worth it until they got exposed, right?

Same too with leaving a major market that itself is a top-run government. And doing so in a way that if the current powers that be stay so, you burnt that bridge.

So. Why is Koch staying there? Why is a business with 115 bil in revenue, 122k employees, keeping a business that's only 6k there?

Option one is that they wanna weather the storm, which is valid. Ideological reasons blah blah.

Option two is that they can't afford to leave.

Can someone better than me look at positions and junk for Koch or for Guardian Industries? Feels like it's weird here. Some thing not right."
wallstreetbet,"3/17/22 SPY Daily TA- Is the bull run officially back on?Is the bull run back on? Or is this market makers playing games? You be the judge‚Ä¶ 

Statistically speaking if spy opens red there is roughly an greater than 80% chance that SPY will also close red that day. Today we see that statistics are not always correct and why we have to put our biases behind us and focus on what the intraday chart shows us. 

https://preview.redd.it/t29y4wywd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe03fe32bd95699cd83928143af59bb99b1163e

Looking at this intraday chart you can see that as soon as market opened the bulls came out swinging and they never really let off the throttle till market closes. Looking at the chart now you can clearly see that bulls broke out, rejected the important 437 resistance, regained steam and then blasted through resistance to new highs. I wasn‚Äôt trading most of the day but I like many got burnt thinking the morning rip was the fake out and that we would sell off the rest of the day. Statistically speaking more times than not we would have been correct. Also it really didn‚Äôt seem like it wanted to break through that oh so important 437 resistance. 

Bulls managed to brake this all the way to 441.07 to close here out today for a modest 1.25% gain. However, after hours saw an immediate sell off and is currently sitting between -0.55 to -0.6% right now and using the 8 ema as resistance instead of support. 

https://preview.redd.it/qmhvdfcyd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c11447d825a6cdb86d84ff82de06da5e359f2d

Looking at my daily chart I can clearly see it is time to make a new channel and see if we can predict where spy is going to go next! Overall the way yesterdays candle finished as a hanging man I am beyond impressed the bulls pushed it green today. Interestingly enough today is technically a hanging man candle also. However, when I look at January 28th, 31st, February 1st and 2nd we actually are seeing a very similar setup today to that. That was the last time there was more than 3 consecutive green candles in a row in over 3 months. Today marks only the second time since December 21st that SPY has managed to have three green days in a row. 

It is also noted that SPY has NOT closed a candle ABOVE the daily 50 ema since February 9th and has only closed one above it (including today) 3 times in over two months. 

This is also the first FULL candle closed ABOVE the daily 20 ema since February 9th and before that it was on January 4th.

Now let me show you a few things I am watching for and seeing on this daily chart as we actually have a few different setups forming. 

https://preview.redd.it/r1nhvmvzd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57521c5ea38ad089f76e609166469e79a1b1aa8d

First up we have this green channel here which COULD be the start of the bull run‚Ä¶ This channel allows us to move as high as the daily 100 ema before we would see much resistance which is around 445 currently. 

https://preview.redd.it/lixzmov0e1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac86c49e56b8d49e652298c545a7675507100d0

Next we have the red bear market channel. This channel would allow SPY to gap up as high as 445-446 (right around the daily 100 EMA also) before it would see any real resistance. 

Now one other thing that I notice looking at todays chart and why its actually very peculiar to me that we hit 441 intraday and rejected so hard downward after hours is that the previous highest high before today was also right at 441. We are currently seeing a double double top at 441 that would if it holds send us crashing back down. Interestingly enough we also have a double bottom near 415. Which if this plays out correctly we could be seeing the following movements to confirm a massive inverse head and shoulder pattern‚Ä¶

 410 ÔÉ† 441 ÔÉ† 415 ÔÉ† 441 ÔÉ† 410?

If we continue to sell off it would be very interesting if we were to retest 410 from this level if bulls fail to regain strength. This pattern actually played out the exact same back in January/ February. 420 ÔÉ† 458 ÔÉ† 444 ÔÉ† 458 ÔÉ† 410. 

History is not predictive of the future. However, it would be quite amazing to see one month+ longer inverse head and shoulders pattern lead right into another. Overall If spy fails to break higher than 441 tomorrow or beginning of next week I would be watching for the retest of 410 before we go any higher. However, if we manage to get a candle closed at or above 445 I am going to be convinced the bull run is back on (for now). 

I am also watching for the possibility of a future 441 double top too. Currently on that path spy is on if it were to dip into next week but effectively trade sideways (much like it did end of January for its double top) we could beginning of April see a triple top at 441 that would surely cause quite the downside. We definitely have some big levels to watch out for tomorrow and next week. 

Tomorrow is the quad witching day which historically in a BULL market results in a usually pretty red day. However, in a bear market im not quite sure what to expect. Chart wise I would be pretty impressed with a 4th red day but the fact that Mondays low was 415.79 and we closed today at 441.07 means that SPY from Mondays low to todays high has gone up over 5.9%. That is an absolute massive gain for one week. Especially when you factor in that spy up until today had not closed back to back green candles in over a month. But for reference the last time SPY had 4 back to back days of green in a row end of January/ beginning of February spy managed to gain over 7.1% in 4 days. 

The one thing we can guaranteed is that we do not know exactly what the market is going to do and we can only be along for the ride. Many of you probably are thinking its time to enter puts because surely its going to go back down. But the one thing we have to remember is that stocks historically go up not down. So in the end as much as this is clearly a bear market we are in‚Ä¶ in the end we are fighting the overall bigger bull trend. 

I am staring at this chart looking for confirmation one way or the other and honestly I cant say I have any. If we break 445 I think that is a bigger signal we are back for the bull run but if we were to get back under 420 range I would think we see 400 before we see 460. In the end today was a massive break for the bulls BUT if you remember back to January. February when we had the massive ‚ÄúV‚Äù recovery from 420 the channel resistance we were in broke yet we continued lower. Again history doesn‚Äôt repeat itself but I am seeing quite a few bear case scenarios vs bull scenarios right now. 

The best thing the bulls do have going for them though is that the VIX is still historically higher than usual sitting at 26. Most of the ‚Äúfear‚Äù around FOMC, rate hikes, war, inflation, etc. is truly (from the horses mouth JPOW himself) PRICED IN. So unless something wild and new happens we should see the VIX attempt to lower itself down into the teens again. The natural easing of fear and the VIX returning to its average below 20 should allow SPY to head back near 450-460s. 

I do ponder if we see a return to a short lived bull run before the next CPI, FOMC and Rate hike. 

This weeks FOMC minutes release on April 7th. And the next FOMC meeting is April 27th. 

The next CPI is not until April 12th

With all that bulls do have some freedom for the next few weeks to unleash the beast again. Tomororw will be an interesting day with the quad witching though but Monday should start the ‚Äúnew trend.‚Äù 

Remember- DM if you wanna keep getting these updates after April 2nd as they will no longer be posted to reddit."
wallstreetbet,Anyone watching APE right now?[removed]
wallstreetbet,"How to Stop Crying - here's your plan. 

TL;DR I'm not doing one. I'm typing all this bullshit to help you. You don't want to read it, don't. Go YOLO your shit into Luckin Coffee, you magnificent retard. I love you.

And don't fucking whine about how this is too long. No one cares and I'm tired of this sub being r/whining.

Alright.¬†

The market is ruining your life. You don't know if we're at bottom or not. But the market is sure you're a bottom and it's coming back to fuck you like a prison inmate again.

Retail investors are plowing money into the market like it's a dime store hooker. Hedge funds are selling off to take their money. Then the stock prices drop, people panic sell. Hedge funds buy all those cheap ass stocks you sold.

So stop that shit. You're making us look bad.¬†

I mean fuck. You're get raped two ways and then come back for more? Smarten up.

I know. I know. You want tendies.¬†

Life is hard. You want to stop falling asleep on your couch while the headboard of your bed bangs the wall while your wife's boyfriend puts his no no in her yes yes.

Shut up. Quit crying. Grab some tissues. Listen up.

1) If you have money in the market that you can't live without, take it out.¬†

This is some basic bitch shit. A volatile market is not the place to invest your rent money.¬†

No, I don't want you to be responsible. And I don't give a fuck if you're homeless. I want you to not make dumb, emotional, irrational decisions. That's how we all get out of this mess.

If you already fucked this part up, you can shut up and hold for years. Or you can shut up, sell at a massive loss and give up.

If you're leveraged, quit that shit. Paying 8% interest for money that loses 20% is a bad bet. Stop paying brokers and banks to fuck you.

2) Hedge money.

""Bur but but what the fuck is that? Is it like shrubbing?""

It's cash you keep as cash that you want to invest later or, if you're more into risk, dump some cash into Inverse Etfs (look them up).¬†

Basically, when the market goes down, they go up. If you use them right, you get to keep your stocks and not take a loss or even make a profit on the ETFs (the jury is still out on if gold is a good hedge or not).

""But but but hedging? But but but inflation. I'll lose money if it sits there.""

Shut up. Inflation is going away. If you invest right you'll make more than inflation will fuck you. And stop buying dumb shit while inflation is high. Don't fuck yourself. You're already getting fucked.

""Now listen here, dinkface. I don't want to hedge. I want to buy the dip. I'm a big bull. My friends and I show each other our big bull balls and swing our dicks at each other to show that we aren't gay bears.""

Shut up. If you want to brag about what kind of animal you are, go to a fucking furry convention. We're here to make money. Money is like your mom. It doesn't care about how big your balls are and it brings me hookers so I can have threesomes with it.

And, shut up, you're still going to buy the dip. But you're going to buy the dip like a man.

What does that mean?

You buy A LITTLE BIT of stocks on the way down (dollar cost averaging, look it up). Buy a LITTLE BIT more every time they have a big dip.

""But but but I don't want to buy a little. I'm a big boy. I buy stocks big. And what if I miss profits? We're already at the bottom.""

Shut up. You're going to make a fuck ton less if you assume we're at the bottom, spend all your cash and then can't buy stocks when they're even cheaper. Anyone who says they know where the bottom is at is a liar or an idiot. I called it wrong once. I'll probably do it again. 

If shit turns around (and wait till that is 100% confirmed, retard), the market isn't going up 800% in a day. You can buy more on the way up and still make money as stocks recover.

""But but but what is a little bit of buying, daddy?""

Quit the daddy shit. It's cool when your mom says it to me. It's creepy when you say it.

Here's a basic rule that will keep you from shitting yourself as you watch your portfolio bleed like it's got a perpetual period.

(And it's a basic fucking rule. I don't think this shit is going to happen so don't chirp about it.)

Whatever you're investing amount is overall, assume you'll lose 50% of that. If that makes your ass pucker, use less money.¬†

Because that's your total budget. Spend it wisely. Spend it in small amounts.

Lots of idiots plowed all their money back into the market in 2000, 2008 when we were nowhere near bottom. Then they sold at bottom.¬†They hate themselves now. Every minute of every day. Some of them are dead. They died with regret.

Don't be an idiot. Yeah, buying something when it's 20% down feels good. You know what feels better? Buying three times as much of that shit when it's 60% down.

3) Pick your stocks in companies that you will be able to hold for 5 years. Maybe you won't have to hold them that long. Maybe you'll have to hold longer. It's a general rule to give you some direction. 

The point is if you buy shit that you have to sell before it recovers, you lose. That's not how buying a dip works. You have to buy it and hold it.

""But but but what do I pick?""

Shut up and choose from these options:

A) Companies that have actual value. If you're smart, look up their p/e p/b ratios. General rule, you want something under 25 p/e and 3 p/b. That's a general rule. Some asshole or kind human will probably give a better benchmark in the comments of this post.

You also want a company that isn't carrying a fuckton of debt. Even when the stock market recovers, things are going to get bad in the economy. If companies go bankrupt you'll be wiping your ass with their stocks.

If you're dumb and don't want to learn simple facts like p/e p/b, just pick big ass companies that don't get destroyed when the economy sucks.¬†

If you want tech, go with Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Not some fucking IPO you heard about from a guy on the bus who probably touches girls while they're sleeping.

B) Buy companies that pay dividends (Google it, I'm not listing them). They'll pay you money even if the stock shits the bed. You may not make money but you'll lose less until things recover.

C) We're going into a recession. I'm not going to explain it. If you think I'm wrong you're the stupidest of the stupid. You should take your money out of the market, buy a gun and shoot your foot off to remind you to be smarter and read basic economic data.

When people realize we're going into a big recession, they will freak out and probably sell a lot of stocks. Don't do that. Plan for it. Plan to buy or plan to hold. Earliest it will hit is probably summer but people will probably start to lose their shit when Q1 earnings start coming in and they suck donkey cock.

In a recession (especially after this wallet raping inflation) people have less money to spend on things they want because they have to spend money on things they need. So don't invest in companies that sell expensive shit that people don't need.

Think on what people buy when they're broke. They buy shit at Dollar Tree and Costco (DLTR COST) They buy food at grocery stores (look up the tickers yourself - not high end grocery stores). They buy fast food instead of eating dinner out (MCD). They buy coke products (I mean the drink - KO). They watch shit on tv (pick a streamer). They still buy alcohol and cigarettes (look them up, I don't buy that shit because I'm ethical as fuck and don't invest in it). Consumer staples like toilet paper and toothpaste (PG JNG). And people still get sick and have to see doctors (UHG).

Buy companies that do well in a recession.¬†

Banks do well in recessions. Banks do well when interest rates are going up (which they are in a big way). Both are happening.

Just know that China's economy is fucked and Russia's economy just got nuked which affected banks all over the world. You might want to see how that global shit works out before you invest in them. Wells Fargo has like 30% short interest right now. That's for a reason.

""But but but my dad buys that stable big value company stocks. I want to buy cool stocks like laser guided robotic cat dildos because I'm awesome. I'm smart, edgy and cool.""

Shut up. You're not. And I'll still let you buy those stocks. Just buy less of those and buy the good ones that have actual revenue on the horizon. Research. Like your dad, it's not hard (which is why your mom left him for me).

If you're really fucking smart, you buy a little with the plan to hold. Then, if a bunch or retards pump up a stock 30% based on nothing, sell that shit, wait for it to tank and rebuy.

""But but but HODL! BUY ALL THE DIPS!!!""

Ok. That's fine by me. You're the reason I've made fat cash off of UPST, PLTR, gold and silver (and then rebought them). You're why I made a shitton off of meme stocks last year. Thanks for that.

""But but but what about other investments that I can't talk about here because of this sub's rules?""

I'll be honest, I don't know how that stuff is going to shake out. I am sure that if you invest in a volatile asset and think it's a hedge you're so stupid it hurts your ancestors.

Yeah, it might be. But no one has proven that. Investment patterns don't support that idea being true. Maybe when the NASDAQ is down 20% it isn't a good time to experiment with a new hedge.

Alright. That's it. Now shut up and get back out there. No more whining.

Later this year if the construction goes as planned they‚Äôll bee hooked up to a nuke plant ‚Äúbehind the meter‚Äù. So they‚Äôll buy power directly from the nuke plant owner without going across a power gird and hence cutting out the grid operator. The arrangement will allow for power to be sold wholesale for cheaper than if the grid distribution was in the middle of this situation. So my question is, how much money can this company make mining the currency? Is WULF a buy and hold stock? Is anyone going to make money on WULF?"

wallstreetbet,"So many losses posts asking for simpathy and confort when you should only invest money you don't needI swear it makes me so sad to see people using their entire savings and money they clearly need, specially when they even didn't earn the money like the guy who lost his grandma savings. 

I mean you need to invest only money you can afford to loose, this is a basic rule. 

If you're greedy and want to make more money no problem but at least do some of this first:

- Read some good books to educate yourself instaed of only getting knowledge from reddit and youtube retard advices that will most likely make you bankrupt;

- Use some kind of limit for your losses and set a plan up where if you reach a certain percentage you'll sell no matter what this way you'll never reach 90% or more of losses; 

- Don't be greedy and start betting to be rich in a day or a week. You're competitors know a lot more than you and you're always on step behing them; 

- Don't be an asshole, have common sense and respect, specially if you didn't earn the money yourself. And if it's yours have some self love and preserv it better for fuck sake."

Things have changed since I said there is not going to be a war. It might. Someone said Putin is smarter than people think, and that is spot on. Not that world leaders don‚Äôt know this, but the world population might not. However, he is also very much into keeping face, showing strength. This is extremely important in Russia, if you show weakness you are immediately under attack by opponents. Putin does not want to lose power, at all cost. My previous post was he has more to lose then gain by attacking Ukraine. Not anymore. The pressure from the US, NATO and in some way the EU has pushed him into a corner. If he backs down, he will look weak to Russians. That will never happen. So how to play this in the market? I don‚Äôt do investment advice, but personally I am watching oil very closely.

They did manage to run blockbusters out of business but at least blockbusters had the fucking movies I wanted to watch. This is a story of why I cancelled my Netflix subscription and why I will be shorting the stock before their next earnings (obv they lost a customer and yes they need my money). So I was chilling and doing my usual daily routine (losing money).  Then I remembered how much I love watching Kill Bill. I've seen it more than 10 times but I enjoy rewatching it every 4-5 months.  But guess what, this dumbfuck company decided to remove Kill Bill from their platform. There I was pissed and scrolling through movies, I've seen Keanu Reeves. Then, I decided that I was going to binge-watch matrix. As I was searching for the Matrix, I realized that there are Matrix parts 1 and 3. Part 2 was nowhere to be found. This made me even more pissed and I have proceeded to cancel my Netflix account. So as you all can see Netflix doing dumbfuck moves. Like why tf would someone remove part 2 and keep the rest.

wallstreetbet,"Nobody Cucks the ZuckMark Zuckerberg sits alone in his office, trying to grasp what has happened.

He's used to the mockery, the roasting; it's been his entire life. He can deal with that. He knows what jokes smell like.

But Facebook? Meta? Up until now they were his shining city on the hill; his magnum opus; his life's greatest achievement.

""Largest single day loss in history..."" He mutters to himself, eyes glazed over, deep in thought, slowly swirling his shirley temple. His second one this week; somebody's not sleeping tonight.

Tim Apple, Muskrat, even that fking cyberboomer Buffett have all been roasting his ass on the daily. On discord no less, they could have at least flamed him on WhatsApp. Not to mention literally everyone in Europe calling his bluff and telling him to gtfo. Even the retards on wsb have been making üåàüêª bank off his misery.

Enough is enough, he thinks to himself. 

Nobody cucks the Zuck.

He flies into action. His heart is literally beating and he knows it. He loves it. What a rush! He's never felt so alive. Revenge will be sweet.

Descending down the crystal staircase from his office, he makes his way to the past the ball pit and his flat warm rock towards the room he thought he'd never have to open. He never thought it would come to this but he knows that he has no other choice.

He approaches the door and licks his lips way too much in preparation of speaking the password:

""Smokin' deez meats."" He whispers, wetly.

The door beeps in agreement, a low hiss fills the air as the door unlocks and slowly swings open.

The room is dimly lit, large and lukewarm; just the way Zuck likes it. And there, directly in the center of the room, an old PC waits patiently for input. The CRT monitor hums ever so quietly from beneath it's very 80's style dust cover; like some shit straight outta Alien.

There it is. His ultimate weapon. His Doomsberg Terminal.

There's no turning back now. He rips the cover off, sits down, and slowly types out the name of his first victim:

""Timothy 'Apple' Cook"". He presses enter.

The off-white 486 whirs into action, retrieving all Tim 'Apple' Cooks Facebook instant messages, every single one, from back before everyone got wise to Zucks plans of stealing personal data to sell oddly specific t-shirts to fucking idiots. He thought it would make him a trillionaire, turns out spreading misinformation amongst the stupid bastards was much more profitable.

(What's that? You thought those messages were deleted when you deleted your FB account? LMAO!)

He begins searching through the messages, looking for some juicy dirt so he can finally bob this Apple, and for good.

It's not long before he finds it: 

\[ Tim Cook \] : So I'm like, ""You're shitting me right, Steve? You're a famous BILLIONAIRE, you could get the best cancer treatment in the history of mankind but instead you're gonna get acupuncture and drink fking Jamba Juice???""

\[ Tim Cook \] : Mfers turtleneck on too tight or something, smh

\[ Tim Cook \] : Anyway bb as I was saying, I need access to all ur pics so I can make sure ur not a pedo k thnx

\[ Some thotty \] : So can you fix my Compaq or nah

This is what Zuck has been waiting for. By threatening to expose Tim Apple as a massive douche who also hates privacy (he shudders at the mere thought of the word) he can blackmail him into reversing Apple's pesky ad revenue ruining policy and regain his rightful place back in the top 10.

He leans back in his chair; revelling in his sheer brilliance. He feels like a big man, not even the biggest congressional booster seat in the world could make him feel this tall. He hasn't felt this good since he saw the Social Network for the first time and asian chick they cast as his future wife was like 1000x hotter than his actual wife and it was confusing but awesome.

He gets up to leave, he's hard af but he doesn't even notice, all he can think about is who his next victim will be. 

Ketchup loving boomer Buffett? 

Tie-dye hippie doofus Dorsey?

Peter ""I'm not a nazi u are"" Thiel?

No.

He knows who should be next.

That autistic twitter tourettes south african retard.

""Musk"" He says. ""If only you could have known..."" He smiles bigly and it's fucking creepy.

""Nobody cucks the Zuck.""

wallstreetbet,"The Official Inflation Numbers Are Correct#Intro

I see an absolutely absurd number of posts and comments being highly upvoted for making the claim that the official CPI numbers are wrong and I'm going to walk you through why that's bullshit. The [CPI (Consumer Price Index)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) *is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.* Now I am aware that it uses the word average in there, and that's not incorrect, but I want you to be aware that it is a weighted average. [Here is the official report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) where you can take a look at page 8 and see relative importance of each category. The following pages break it down further in an incredible amount of detail. 

#How Do We Know It Is Correct

This is a fair question, but it's so rarely asked in good faith. It's almost exclusively asked as a way to cast doubt on the index with no real backing as to why it could be incorrect. People repeatedly will make statements like *My food costs 40% more now, explain that!* or *What about housing costs? Why don't they directly include those huh?* and then almost always refuse to accept any explanation or even consider looking at the data. So let's look at that data together. As I already showed, you can see the exact details of what items are included and their weights. You can also look at the prices graphed very nicely over the last 20 years! For example, [here is the price of tomatoes per pound since 2002](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm). 

Now you might see that tomato chart and say *Checkmate, tomatoes where I live cost 2x that much! That means that this whole index is severely underreporting!* This is the equivalent of saying *I knew someone who smoked for 40 years and never got any kind of cancer, therefore smoking doesn't cause cancer.* It's anecdotal evidence. You cannot assume that what you experience represents what the millions of other people across the country experience. You could talk to 5 friends from 5 different states who all happen to agree with you and it's still such an incredibly small, and likely biased group, that it does not accurately represent the entire country. 

The other major factor at play is cost of living. Maybe your experience is not an outlier, but you simply live in a high cost of living area. This doesn't really impact inflation because that's a percent increase, but it will impact your perception of the average prices. A person who lives in New York City might laugh at the idea of $1,500 rent. A person who lives in Nowhere, Idaho might think $1,500 for rent is insane. You're not limited to your city to see what prices are. You have access to the internet and if you wanted to do a thorough study of prices, you could. (More on this later). 

So why is the CPI data correct? It's correct because it's completely open and transparent. If the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) were lying about data **anyone would be able to find it and clearly point it out as being fraudulent**. Any credible news organization that did this could have a massive story... but in order to do this they would need to be able to prove the data was bad, which is why that hasn't happened. One of the common and weak attempts at proving this point without having to read anything is when people claim that the fact that housing prices are not included directly somehow shows that the resulting index is not accurate.

#Housing
The CPI data includes rent, which makes sense, and then it also includes something called OER (Owners Equivalent Rent). OER asks homeowners this exact question: *If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?* What is the purpose of this? It's to gauge how much people are spending on their homes. If your mortgage is $1,000 per month would you claim to be willing to rent it for $800 per month? Of course not. You also have to factor in property taxes and possible damages they may cause. It creates a number that represents how much homeowners spend on the home itself. Things like utilities and materials purchases to run or improve the home are accounted for in other CPI categories. Everything in the CPI is measuring how much people spend and how that spending changes. The pieces of data covered in OER account for that spending. The actual cost of an entire home is not an amount that most people pay at one time. If you want to know about home prices, there's a separate index for that [here](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index.aspx). 

#Two Factor Authentication
I think being open source and incredibly transparent is more than enough for this index to be considered accurate and trustworthy - but, for those who are really pessimistic there is a way to verify everything mentioned here. The [Billion Prices Project](http://www.thebillionpricesproject.com/) is a collaborative effort between MIT and Harvard to scrape the internet everyday for every price out there. They are doing exactly what I mentioned anyone could do before and actually check the data for inconsistencies. [Here is a paper that covers the methodology and a lot of other details](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.30.2.151). For those who just want to get to the data, [here](https://www.pricestats.com/inflation-series?chart=1837) is a sample they provide that shows how the BPP's stats compare to the official CPI numbers. Unsurprisingly, they're incredibly similar. CPI data is released monthly while BPP releases data daily. You need to request data from them under *access* and they will email it to you. 

#Conclusion 
**If you're going to read anything please read this!**

Let's just take a second to think about what would need to be true for inflation data to be false. If you think inflation is higher than reported, this is what you need to justify. 

 * The BLS decided to intentionally mislead you
 * They somehow hid this amongst their completely open source, verifiable data
 * MIT and Harvard are both also trying to mislead you in the same way
 * They somehow hid this amongst their DIFFERENT completely open source, [verifiable data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FIAH6Z6)
 * Every single news organization has failed to find how they reached these fake results using the data provided
 * Every single research organization has failed to find how they reached these fake results using the data provided

If you believe that CPI and inflation data are significantly inaccurate you are deluding yourself in a reality that doesn't exist and I advice you take a deep look into some of the resources provided. I know this post wasn't as much about investing as the others but I think it is incredibly important to keep your reality in check. Please feel free to share this anywhere and with anyone who may need it."

wallstreetbet,"How world issues will influence the stock market in the futureAs many of you know, the stock market is tanking again over fears that Russia will invade Ukraine, sparking outrage among the bulls and honey for the bears. Yours truly, TheAssExtracter, who has lost 97% of their portfolio and is hanging on by a dick hair, has desperately done several days worth of DD that I would like to share with you. Surely, my market hypothesis will benefit a lot of you. 

Biden has been rambling about how Russia plans to manufacture a pretext for war, making the invasion imminent. What if all this media/propaganda is actually manufacturing the pretext for the US to get involved. ‚Ä¶. Genius. Tricky democratic president wanting to stick his limp, shriveled vegan penis into a hot, exotic Russian babe. This will of course tank the market and you should buy puts. Combined with JP talking again in March, recession will happen, but it won‚Äôt come to pass. 

Tbh, I sympathize with Russia, they are the victims. All they want is for Ukraine to be neutral, so they don‚Äôt have to be neighbors with a NATO ally, who will slowly finger their tight Russian butthole. Meanwhile, Ukraine herself will literally receive a colonoscopy in the form of a German pipe. 

Really, alpha Putin has a big red button (200k troops), and pushing it causes US investor panic. He can do this indefinitely, until Ukraine bends the knee. My thought is that the Russian invasion has already been priced in (after hours on Friday, and throughout last week). So buying puts at this point is a trap. 

Why is Russia threatening to invade now, of all times? Inflation. Timing is everything. The truth is that alpha Putin sees the inflation weakness of the US and wants to add pressure, basically shorting the US into a panic-induced recession. Once Biden successfully manages to finally swallow his viagra by lubing it with overpriced oil, he will become hard enough again to push against Russia. Ukraine will not join NATO yet, and Russia will agree to postpone so they don‚Äôt face sanctions. They will pull another stunt when the time is right, maybe elections. 

If an invasion were to happen, if you were in alpha Putin‚Äôs place, many would agree to save this move for a Republican leadership in America, as they don‚Äôt give a fuck about Ukraine. Tbh, no average American really gives a fuck about Ukraine. I expect a market bounce next week, as tensions relieve and peace gets priced in. Maybe this is my trauma from NVDA earnings speaking, retard learning that everything is priced in and that the market is illogical, and so we should think without logic.  

So, given this dissertation, we should all buy CALLS next week, and sell puts at market open (I doubled my money on DASH puts)."

**$SPY** Support \~430

**$QQQ** Support \~350, \~320

This week I would like to bring some more attention to the tech sector in the market.  These more speculative stocks have been hit hard in this selloff, something key to look for is: the 50 day moving average crossing the 200 day moving average.  When this happens it is known as the ""death cross"" many funds will not even invest in stocks where the 50 day moving average is below the 200 because historically: ""death crosses"" are followed by a long term bear market.  The RSI is approaching 0 so if there is a panic selloff in the beginning of the week I will buy $UPRO and catch a bounce for a quick profit.

Surprisingly bonds have traded flat this week.  I would argue this is a bearish sign for the economy since the yields are holding this level and it is historically high compared to the past year.

The equity market liquidity is how easily a security can be bought/sold in the markets.  This means the bid/ask spread is increasing and transactions will have a greater effect on the stocks price.  This is an extremely bad sign for the overall market.

**Predictions**

This week will be very volatile again especially with the rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine.  I am a lot more uncertain this week in the markets since there is so many indicators to analyze.  This may be a good thing though because more uncertainty in the markets can cause huge panic sells which creates opportunities.  The support level on $SPY at \~430 is very weak and could be easily broken on with strong selling pressure on Tuesday.  Then the price will most likely fall down to \~415.  What most technical traders and intuitions will be watching is the futures on Monday, for those who do not know yet: all US markets will be closed on Monday for presidents day.  The futures market will open at 6pm EST on Sunday.  

I closed my $UVXY position on Friday about 1pm EST for a 20% gain.   I did this because of the uncertainty with Russia and the markets being closed on Monday.  This week I will be looking for a panic selloff in the overall markets by checking the RSI. Catching a bounce should not be too hard... I don't want to speak too soon though.

It will definitely be another red week for $SPY but I just did not have enough confidence to hold my position over the weekend.  Remember ‚ÄúRisk comes from not knowing what you are doing.‚Äù I won't be opening any positions on Tuesday when the markets open, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to make a trade.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

Uncertainty in the markets, could see big üåàüêª moves followed with a bounce from \~415

wallstreetbet,"Weekend Discussion of New Derivatives MarketI never post, but found a new exciting market I need to figure out the structure of and how to profit.  I figured it was right up you degenerates' alley.

Okay, I have some junior degenerates we'll refer to by age to keep them straight.  My three kids (12, 10 and 7) have apparently been trading ""souls"" for candy and cash.  I heard 10 telling 12 he would trade 7's soul for a candy bar, then deliver Wednesday when 7 sold him his soul for $.50 to buy stuff at the student store at school, and 12 can then sell it back to 7 for $.75 on Saturday.

So...now we're looking to break up the soul derivatives market, and I tell 12 and 10 we do not trade souls, and tell 10 that daddy is the only one allowed to sell naked options in this house.  I then tell them not to take advantage of their little brother (7)...and the true market structure is revealed.

Apparently 12 has two souls from 7 and 10 has two contracts to buy souls from 7 for $.50 due the next week.  10 has been buying souls every Wednesday at that price for a few weeks now when 7 wants funds for the student store.  Apparently 10 thinks 7 has been buying his soul back each weekend when he has just been issuing new souls. So, while these two are trading souls and soul futures back and forth, 7 has apparently been acting as the central bank selling fiat souls into the whole economy to make out like a bandit.  

So...I need to know first...who is grounded?   Is 7 growing up to be a banker or a Bond villain? 

Second, with this entire economy being based on a 7 year old's willingness to sell his soul every time he wants a pencil, do I sell a bunch of his souls short and get my kids to do some laundry and dishes before inflation kicks in?  If 7 was smart enough to start selling synthetic souls, am I setting myself up to be caught in a short squeeze if he decides to restrict the currency flow?  I am all about getting some chores done, but not if it means 7 pinches me for a trip to Disney World to settle later...."

Of course the data comes from Fed itself. They are required to publish the data. Powell goes in front of the camera and says we are tapering to fight inflation, but the money printer keeps running full speed. They count on the fact that you idiots can't make any sense out of numbers.

The balance sheet is basically the sum of all printed $$. To understand tapering, you need to look at the **slope** (it's like the difference between the deficit and the debt, which is another one that you idiots don't get). So long it goes up, that means they are buying even more than what is needed to replace the maturing securities. The much quoted $120B/month are the purchases **in excess** of what's needed for replacing the maturing. The total purchases are even higher.

Tapering means that the slope should come down, so that it becomes flat in March. At that point, they would not print new $$$, but would continue with new purchases just to keep it flat. However, the slope is still almost what it was through last year. That means tapering is not happening! At this rate, I doubt they'll flatten the sheet by March.

Now, unprinting the $$$$$ would mean that they would purchase less that what's needed for replacing the maturing. That would change the sheet to pointing **downwards**. That's a whole other story, and that won't happen without a market crash. I doubt it will happen at all, unless we see 50% inflation of something like that."

Deutsche Bank released a statement Friday saying¬†that it¬†is¬†‚Äúwinding down‚Äù operations in Russia following criticism of¬†its previous stance to stay in the country.¬†

‚ÄúDeutsche Bank has substantially reduced its Russian exposure since 2014. Like some international peers and in line with our legal and regulatory obligations, we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations. There won‚Äôt be any new business in Russia,‚Äù the bank said.¬†

The decision to leave Russia came a day after the company told its staff it would not be pulling out of Russia despite dozens of other companies and banks doing so.¬†

This time IS a little different in that I've never seen growth stocks get completely cleaned out in a matter of months.. like 50% off the highs and I'm pretty sure wallstreet is gonna short them to pennies.

So if inflation and Ukraine isn't the headline, than what is?

The sectors being bought and sold suggest wallstreet is heavily buying into recession stocks but the heavy concentration into large caps, gold, and oil means they're also targeting the systemic risk stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**JPMorgan says it's hiring 'thousands of individuals with criminal backgrounds' amid the labor shortage**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;JPMorgan Chase is taking an ""unconventional"" approach to combatting the labor shortage.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;It's hiring thousands of workers with criminal records, an executive told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/jpmorgan-says-labor-shortage-requires-unconventional-hiring.html).¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Employers have had difficulty hiring and retaining employees amid what's been dubbed the Great Resignation.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;JPMorgan says it's pulling out all the stops to combat the labor shortage that's affecting many US businesses. That includes casting a wider net and hiring people that have historically had difficulty finding employment.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;The US' largest bank has hired thousands of people with criminal records and hundreds with disabilities like autism, Brian Lamb, JPMorgan's global head of diversity, equity, and inclusion, said during a [CNBC event](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/jpmorgan-says-labor-shortage-requires-unconventional-hiring.html) on Thursday. JPMorgan employs well over 200,000 people.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Contending with the labor shortage ‚Äî which has seen masses of Americans walk off the job and made it more difficult for employers to hire ‚Äî ""is going to require unconventional approaches,"" Lamb said. Job seekers no longer need to answer questions about their criminal backgrounds on the bank's initial applications, he said.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;The company is ""tapping into the talent pools that have historically been left behind,"" Lamb said. Formerly incarcerated people often have a more difficult time getting hired.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pandemic gave rise to what has been dubbed the Great Resignation. Millions of workers have quit their jobs for [myriad reasons](https://www.businessinsider.com/potential-reasons-explain-labor-shortage-open-jobs-not-enough-workers-2021-12), including stagnant wages, inadequate flexibility, a desire to switch careers, and shifting childcare needs.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;It's forced some companies to offer higher wages and better perks to would-be workers. Major chains like [McDonald's](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-raise-helped-ease-the-labor-shortage-2021-7), CVS, [Chipotle](https://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-mexican-grill-to-raise-wages-to-an-average-of-15-an-hour-2021-5?r=US&amp;IR=T), and Walgreens have boosted pay to attract and retain talent.¬†

wallstreetbet,"3/11/22 Weekly SPY AnalysisWell today was quite the exciting day if you ask me! 

After many saw that pre-market spike to 433.22 they thought we for sure had a green day secured in the bag. Only thing was the markets had something else planned that many did not expect and those who played the market as it lies were rewarded greatly! 

https://preview.redd.it/son0vjqcavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc65e2a536cdfa6da3ca839b3e377686f99c4d7

When I look at this chart I actually see the STRONGEST put signal from 0815am this morning all the way until right now as market is closing. The crazy thing that if you were to block all the white noise, all the Biden speech pumps, all the Russia bs, all the pumps and dumps intraday and you looked at this chart here. You would see that in almost 14 hours of trading there was only ONE 15 minute candle closed above the 8 ema. That is some hella bearish movement. You could have entered a put at market open and not touched it till end of day and easily made 100-200% gains on your puts. However, of course intraday we have so much going on we can not be so objective. 

Technical wise today had you just watch the 8 ema you would have been sitting pretty. But of course we have the classic sell off as Biden speaks followed by a big rally which we saw attempt to happen two times today. We also saw the VIX peak near 30.4 at 955am this morning and continue to fall as SPY continued to fall, which was interesting to watch. However, we saw around 240pm the VIX go on a massive fear run breaking its 8 ema and peaking at 31.04 before market closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zu6t15tdavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9721c49c51293f43bc48b26eb1754aeb0aa99fe8

 if you follow me and were in the live chat today intraday around noon I mentioned SPY was testing its upward channel support and that if it broke the 424 support we would be breaking the channel and should see a big run down which can to happen exactly as I had mentioned. That‚Äôs why watching not only intraday but daily trends is so important. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/es3skajfavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4637043c677b12d440eac3e4c580a7926fb496f3

 Which leaves us with this very nice looking bear channel that I also mentioned to keep an eye on. We have officially hit the upper resistance with that pre-market move to 433 and now naturally it makes sense to see it test the support line which puts SPY next week testing support levels between 400 and 410. If you remember last time SPY hit its new lower low of 410 it immediately sky rocketed back up‚Ä¶ we very well may see some of that same movement happen next week.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pnix2xigavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad74cba66f0f82571a4740043329461c42c893e

As mentioned this morning and intraday in the live what does this chart show you? Does it show you a bull chart or a massive bear chart? We are 100% without a doubt in a bear market. Even CNBC said we are super close to triggering their ‚Äúextreme bear market‚Äù indicator that hasn‚Äôt hit since 2008 I guess. 

Todays intraday movement and this daily candle finish was very important to me and very foretelling for what is going to happen next week. We have a bearish engulfing candle on the daily, we once again after breaking the daily 8 ema failed to close the candle above it. Looking at the EMAs the daily 8 and daily 20ema are damn near falling straight vertical down now we have such a bearish sentiment on the chart. The daily 50 ema closed in even closed to the daily 200 ema leaving only $3.5 left before the death cross happens‚Ä¶ We could see this death cross play out as early as Friday next week if we see some similar movement as this week and fail to make any significant upward movement. 

If you remember next week we have the oh so awaited first rate hike and FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It is going to be VERY interesting to see not only what JPOW has to say but what he chooses to do with the rate hike. Remember Thursday markets despite expected CPI did not like it and sold off still. I think next week we are going to see some fireworks on Wednesday and Thursday. IF I was a betting man its going to be the same thing as last week on Wednesday when JPOW testified we saw a fuck you green day followed by 4 very red days. 

10% challenge-

This was not my best week but overall a good week. I was attempting a few different strategies and pushing myself past my comfort zone and it did not pay off. I look forward to getting back to my tried and true method that works out well for me. But overall it was a good week. 

I made 15 trades and had 8 green and 7 red. 

Goal of the week is $2500/ week or $500/ day

I managed to net a profit of $1100 this week averaging a terrible 4% on the trades I made. 

Next week I need to get back on my game and back to the strategy that‚Äôs never failed me. No more pushing hard or making risk trades for no reason at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I started off the year with 170k in value and ended the year with about 162k in value according to statements. However, Robinhood shows that due to wash sales, I made 21k. 

Is it possible to pay taxes even if I'm losing money overall? I read that I can use tax harvesting so I can use 3k to offset these losses until I'm cleared. I know I became extra retarded in the name of greed so I would like to know how you can mitigate this. 

This year I started off at 160k and now I'm sitting at ..... 71k (I'm numb and can't feel pain anymore) and I'm sure I'm falling under wash sales again because I bought same SPY/QQQ/TSLA etc. contracts multiple times and ended up losing even more money. What will this mean for me for rest of the year?

wallstreetbet,"Shiller CAPE shows S&amp;P 500 adjusted has nowhere to go but down. I have added a few data points to the chart to help my fellow Apes identify significant historical moments.CAPE - the 10 year Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500. This ratio indicates how much investors in the S&amp;P 500 today are paying for shares compared to the total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 adjusted for inflation. 

As you can see from the chart CAPE is moderately successful indicator of an over-valued market. Historically the Shiller CAPE index spends relatively little time above 25. It is currently around 34, the second highest price to earnings ratio since the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble.  Clearly this is bad because the dotcom bubble was the bullish economy's version of a paper-tiger. You can see the precipitous decline that occurred when that bubble burst.  

Based on the CAPE Shiller Index the S&amp;P 500 can easily lose 30% of its value and remain outside of its highest valuations in comparison to its production. Why SPY could rebound merely on market sentiment it is nowhere close to the bottom. At least according to one fundamental metric the SPY and probably should continue to decline throughout 2022 and low returns are likely for up to a decade as the markets production grows to meet its valuation. 

I have included a link to the current CAPE and a link to an article that includes some of the shortcomings of this methodology.

How To DIRECTLY REGISTER retirement shares in your IRA!!!

Hi r/wallstreetbets!!, I have been a long-time lurking ape, who writes shit comments, and now I am here to offer an educational methodology on how to DRS YOUR IRA SHARES. I hope this post saves you months on the IRA DRS journey by setting you up for the financial freedom, as well as a providing a wrinkle or two, and a means to not be reliant on the Ponzi artists who decide what is best for you and your retirement funds. A special thanks to @ u/HOLDstrongtoPLUTO for the MeMe contribution, post contributions, and a lot of therapy over this process!

***To be clear although I have verified with my custodian both old and new, and Computershare that this process will DRS my shares while maintaining IRA tax status, I have not received a purple ring so far.***

 

[\(will post upon receipt\)](https://preview.redd.it/ingkz1r5lum81.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a36e9999ef27008f603911d0ea02acfaa55fd73d)

So, let me jump into my method, which is very simple for individual investors to complete‚Ä¶ by using a **self-directed IRA (Roth, Traditional, SEP, Simple)**. This is not your typical ‚Äúretail marketed, self-directed brokerage IRA‚Äù through the major broker-dealers. This is through a custodian that allows for real assets to be held, they are not a broker and will not touch my stonks. These types of IRAs empower their account holders to hold 1) investments in real estate, 2) hard assets, 3) private company holdings, and 4) other lucrative, but historically, restricted investments not afforded from Wall Street brokerage houses. As I‚Äôm sharing my experience, I‚Äôd like to bring your attention to the third type, private company holdings, specifically, a single member LLC. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ranht5r4lum81.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8baad4cbd123ed833b9b8879fe4766e49b2cbf65

The asset held by my self-directed IRA is just an LLC.. **let that sink in for a second, because it‚Äôs a critical component to understand about this process**. This LLC has a bank account, and **contributions to the bank account must be from LLC business/asset sales, or CONTRIBUTIONS/ROLLOVERS VIA the Custodian or my Self-Directed IRA**. *In my excitement after forming the LLC, I wanted to start the Computershare account and buy a share with personal funds, but.. I realized that would have been a mistake because it‚Äôs important to route the money through the custodian, and LLC bank account.* **Patience is a virtue, don‚Äôt cut corners because of MOASS FOMO, it‚Äôs been over a year!**

These types of LLCs are commonly called ‚ÄúCheck-book IRA LLCs‚Äù. Now, there are very strict laws pertaining to money motion on this type of LLC, if it is solely owned by a retirement account (Bonus banana: these ‚ÄúCheck-book IRA LLCs‚Äù can have multiple owners for those married/teamed apes). Once the 1) LLC (‚ÄúCheck-book IRA LLCs‚Äù) is formed under the IRA and 2) a bank account is set up owned by the LLC, the LLC can directly buy shares at the beloved Computershare for the benefit of the LLC and in turn, the Self-Directed IRA! For me personally, I contribute cash through the Custodian,  via [**Madison Trust**](https://signup.madisontrust.com/forms/Account_Setup?Reference=Josowitz,%20Michael&amp;ReferralSource=Mark%20Lalich). I am sure there are others as well, but they work for me.

**Most importantly my shares locked in those broker dealers IRAs can be ‚Äúdirectly registered‚Äù using a letter of authorization/instruction (LOA) naming the LLC as the new owner! They will treat this as a distribution and report it as so, however this can be remedied by my CPA &amp; Custodian later since the IRS views this as a LIKE to LIKE transfer. It is imperative to inform the custodian of the new IRA of the transfer date and total value of the distribution so they can ensure proper books!**

See, broker dealers will not help, provide info, or assist in removing retirement shares from ‚Äústreet name‚Äù, which is why a letter of authorization/instruction was necessary. **They legally must comply and follow these LOA instructions.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7e6icev3lum81.png?width=395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26f83f9a07806920a05bf5a53f5a3f1c5413d434

I doubt this is the only method; it is not the cheapest either.. I spent about $2000 for set-up and annually it is $95/quarter for the custodian and ongoing LLC expenses of course will come. However, I personally find it to be the best method to take ownership of my shares and remove them from the DTCC and is the most risk-averse option I have found to date, since all other options leave my shares in brokerage control. I do not want to trust anyone but the transfer agent with these shares after the past year‚Ä¶

I have included a step-by-step with a link to where I got started, feel free to use, or not, feel free to recommend your friends and family, they do have a referral option!  **Half of any referrals I receive will be split between my DRS shares(25%) &amp; Charitable Org DRS shares(75%) at CS (Wil absolutely provide proof).**  This link will directly connect you with who I worked with on this entire process @[ **Madison Trust**](https://signup.madisontrust.com/forms/Account_Setup?Reference=Josowitz,%20Michael&amp;ReferralSource=Mark%20Lalich). He was very helpful and again helped crack this code after hours of discussions and back and forth. LES GO!

**The first step is to set up your Self-Directed IRA at Madison Trust, the link below will get you started:** 

[**Madison Trust**](https://signup.madisontrust.com/forms/Account_Setup?Reference=Josowitz,%20Michael&amp;ReferralSource=Mark%20Lalich) **sign up!**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/io74cw13lum81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e83700e17e216599f7c39388bec1139e82a06db

The process is about a 5‚Äì10-minute application, $595, and requires an e-signature. Boom!!.. the self-directed is set up!! The cost consists of 1) the opening minimum $500 account balance and 2) first quarter custodian fee. Next you will need an asset for the self-directed IRA, this asset is an LLC. Legal limitations exist on assets which can be held via the LLC (make sure to check your states laws, and this is where companies like Madison Trust have expertise in guiding to the correct legally-complaint solutions), however they are generally assets/collectibles with opaque valuations to minimize fraud. So, the LLC buying a picture your kid painted for $ 1MM would not work, other collectibles as well do not meet the requirements, however real estate, private companies, securities all make the cut.

**Madison Trust, the custodian,** will recommend their partner, **Broad Financial, for the LLC set-up, this costs $1500.** (It is important to note, you may be able to use other companies to set up the LLC, I just have not tried anyone else personally). You name the LLC (and I‚Äôm sure there will be some good ones apes come up with lol e.g. Hed‚ÄôR‚ÄôFuk‚Äôd LLC) and they take it from there. I found it important to pay to have the LLC set up because this is not a normal LLC, and very specific articles and operating agreements need to be written. My turnaround from Madison Trust account open to LLC documents complete and ready to go was less than a week but if the masses flood as I expect it to, this processing time may slow that down a bit. These ‚Äúcustodians‚Äù are not Fidelity, Chuck, etc., they are smaller companies so be patient as they are facilitating the way. They let me know they were ready for the flood, and ‚Äúchallenge accepted‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cqn8ig12lum81.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d833e6d2fba22ba70be664422c7614c4543b49d

Broad financial partners with Solera National Bank, was a very easy process, also a friendly admin team to set up the bank account for the LLC. This is very quick 1-day turnaround, however, **DO NOT JUST DEPOSIT MONEY INTO THIS BANK ACCOUNT!!!! It is very important to utilize the custodian (Madison Trust) you choose to make money movements**. Once you find your bank you can buy shares directly.. While this is not the fastest Venmo of your life or the simplest process it keeps everything legal and in order, very important and worth the wait time. This process is synonymous with that of systems like Computershare‚Äôs and can often be archaic, **but we all have learned that expeditious pace has a VERY REAL cost.**

The next step is quite simple but it‚Äôs critical to pay attention to details of completing the Letter of Authorization/Instruction you send to the current custodian raking in profits by fucking you out of your shares. While every custodian may be different on what they want, the general flow is 1) What you want, 2) from where, 3) how much, 4) to who, 5) **SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO DRS YOUR SHARES WITH YOUR SPECIFIC BROKERAGE** (Each brokerage has slightly differing protocols).

The letter of authorization will force the broker-dealer to take the shares out of ‚Äòstreet name‚Äô and directly register them at Computershare in the name of your LLC. You must provide the details per their instructions. All broker-dealers have 1) Asset Transfer Services and 2) Retirement Services departments who are the best sources of information to help understand and process your Direct Registration LOA Instructions, because they are the two departments processing this Letter of Instruction. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TRYING TO OPEN AN ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT AT THE BROKER-DEALER, AND AFTER TWO WEEKS THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY AND MOST OTHER BROKER DEALERS DON‚ÄôT DO THIS FOR LLC‚Äôs owned by IRAs. THIS WAS THE MOMENT OF CLARITY FOR ME THAT THE LOA WAS THE SILVER BULLET TO DRS IRA SHARES. At the same time, you will need to submit an asset transfer form to Madison Trust or your self-directed IRA custodian to maintain compliance with record keeping. This asset transfer form simply notifies the custodian of the transfer date, asset type, total value, and the source of the additional LLC value when reporting it. Here is an example: [LOA Example](https://www.veritasacademy.net/editoruploads/files/Give/Stock%20Transfer%20Template.pdf). My Broker took a couple of days to bounce it around, but persistence in the end is key, and eventually was told the reluctant okay.

One interesting piece of this entire experience was towards the end of this journey, when my custodian, one of the big three oddly, asked me to move my assets, claiming my investment style was not **‚Äúin line with their business model‚Äù** and I would be better served elsewhere‚Ä¶ Very timely‚Ä¶

Congratulations, you made it!!.. I appreciate your time reading through this process! [**Madison Trust**](https://signup.madisontrust.com/forms/Account_Setup?Reference=Josowitz,%20Michael&amp;ReferralSource=Mark%20Lalich), I encourage you to pay it forward, and apes/apettes, tell your friends if you want! It was a hell of a lesson in the financial sector, quite the journey, and I am now on the way to an XXXX DRS for my Roth account without paying any penalties or losing tax status.

**TL;DR - ELI5 ‚Äì HOW TO DIRECT REGISTER DRS IRA SHARES (THIS COSTS ABOUT \~$2200 to setup, varies by state)**

**1) Open a self-directed IRA capable of holding an LLC,** [**Madison Trust**](https://signup.madisontrust.com/forms/Account_Setup?Reference=Josowitz,%20Michael&amp;ReferralSource=Mark%20Lalich) **for reference they charge $595**

**2) Open the LLC for the IRA w/link provided by your custodian, I used BROAD FINANCIAL as mine and cost $1500.**

**3) About a week later the LLC should be established, and ready for you to receive/sign official onboarding package with the rules of the road, and all necessary information for DRS.**

**4) DRS your shares into Computershare using a Letter of Authorization (LOA) sent to your current broker-dealer naming the LLC as the new owner. The sub not to be named DRS guide will fill any holes you have about the Computershare site.**

**5) Inform adviser/rep at the custodian throughout the process.** \[I personally used an Asset Transfer Form to my custodian with date stock was transferred/purchased, total amount, asset type.\]

**Again, the BD will see it as a distribution, but this is a like to like transfer to your new custodian, and your CPA will process it as so. Ensure your CPA is educated with this for obvious reasons.** 

**PS: This is not financial advice, it is simply an account of my experience DRSing my retirement shares.**

wallstreetbet,"From 10k to loser to 50k challenge using SPY 0DTE option trading - Update 5I had previously mentioned I am going to continue posting this thread everyday. I missed few days. Here is my update. I had some losers and winners. Definitely the winners wining the trades. My account wasn't doing much going deep downtrend until started doing 0DTE options. My target was $100 a day. Recently I was able to make $300 to $500 every day consistently.  I use to get upset and down when my trade goes against. Also wait too much to cut down my loses. 

1. Nowadays learnt to trade without emotion (not completely , but improved). 
2. This helped me to quickly jump from losing trade to cut loss immediately, and catchup with trends. Now I learnt not to fight the market and let it drive my trading plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my wins. I am up $2k for Feb and $1k for March. Now everything is big both loss and wins. Win I lose, i immediately counter trade and exit with profit there by always maintaining profit for the day. I exceed 300% to 500% my daily $100 profit. 

I didn't trade on the missing days in the screenshot due to my work.

wallstreetbet,"SEC delisting Chinese stocks....conspiracy?Hi. I'm a typical, low level wallstreet reta\*d, so forgive me if the post is dumb, obvious etc. But I want you thoughts.

Chinese tech listings (TECHY, BABA) are getting consistently hammered. If you take Alibaba, on just about all accounts it a great company to invest in for the long term, P/E, MOAT, growth, competition, Cloud etc Yet the NYSE ADR BABA is under constant threat of being delisted due to ""Audit concerns"". 

My thought. America is just casting doubt on these companies to **stop the money flowing into China**, and to help the American based companies (Amazon in this case), to outcompete and hence earn more money which they then profit off by collecting tax, jobs etc. 

So, with this in mind, the strategy. Never invest in good companies that are in competition to American companies, short ones that are listed on the NYSE for the long term, even if they are great (ad after that have been listed for long enough to have a decent amount of outside capital).

wallstreetbet,"Stocks can‚Äôt go negative? I have an ideaSo everyone says stocks can‚Äôt go negative. Maybe not in the literal sense of the word but the holder could go negative from holding it.
So you have to find a way of commoditising a stock for it to go negative. But how can you do that? 

Well you would have to find a broker that charges you running fees, and fixed buy and sell fees (not fees based on percentile), plus one that has a tiny minimum buy amount. 
Then all you need to do is buy the smallest position possible of the absolute worst stock you can find. 

They already charge a spread so just buying alone makes you instantly lose some money, but the stock needs to be cheaper then the sale fee as well, or on track to go lower (that‚Äôs important don‚Äôt forget).


So there we have it, you would be paying to hold or sell it.

wallstreetbet,"The DRS/direct registration/switch from street name to record name ""movement"" is a bonafide Reddit Moment.I am a corporate lawyer. I represent public companies. I have watched from the side lines as you all have talked for the last year or so about how revolutionary you are being by demanding the transfer agents of the companies in which you own stock move your shares from the street names of your brokers to your own registered names at AST, ComputerShare, EQ (pre-merger) etc. Here is an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate\_wall\_street/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate_wall_street/) My impression has been, wow, these people really have no idea how absolutely insignificant this move is to the brokers weighed against the negative effects it is likely to have on their companies, whose expenses for administering this increased number of registered SHs are going to go up substantially. Now I'm starting to see the rubber meet the road. This week I saw the first invoices from Broadridge for annual meeting services this year, which are up 35-65% for  my clients because their registered shareholder pool has gone up by, depending on the client, hundreds/thousands of individuals/entities because of your ""movement."" I guess you don't realize that for every new registered shareholder, the company has to pay like $1,000 extra each year to Broadridge for searches, report tabulation, voting, mailing proxy statements and cards, mailing annual reports, etc. not to mention many issuers are now exceeding the limits of the transfer agent contracts so they are paying per SH out the ass to AST/Computershare. I am seeing company's annual meeting bills and transfer agent quarterly invoices go up by $100,000s for absolutely no reason. I can only imagine how crazy the transfer agent/Broadridge bills are this year for a true meme stock like GME; I assume at least $1 million. I really have no skin in this game other than the solvency of my clients so they can pay my invoices and I don't really care either way really except I think it's funny to point out that by taking this untutored stance against your brokers who, trust me, don't give a shit whether your 23 GME shares are on their books or AST's, you are actually costing the companies you are trying to long literally hundreds of thousands of dollars for basically no reason (not to mentioned the poor beleagured stock administration teams at your portfolio companies who are like, ""wait, what someone wants to hold 7 shares at AST, that's like 20 minutes of paperwork I didn't need or want to add to my plate"").

From everything I‚Äôve read online and in Biden‚Äôs state of the union speech I‚Äôm getting the impression that the west (and reddit in general) is delusional about Russia and Putin at the moment. I believe these things to be true:

Russia is going to level Ukraine‚Äôs major cities just like Putin did in Grozny. The losses so far will only lead them to indiscriminately bomb and starve Kiev and Kharkiv. Zelensky, if he miraculously survives, will sour on the west for not giving them military aide and he will negotiate a surrender.

Financial sanctions will continue but will have no real impact on the situation militarily.

Russian oil and natural gas will never be sanctioned and will only have reduced consumption over the next 10 years in the west which will be offset by China‚Äôs increases in consumption.

Since oil makes up around 40% of Russia‚Äôs budget and they have large reserves in foreign currency and gold they will have more than enough to finance this war, quite possibly another following it.

After seeing the disaster in Afghanistan and Russia taking Ukraine, China will move to take Taiwan.

China takes Taiwan easily. More Western Sanctions. Cold War II Market Crash before 2030.

wallstreetbet,"Don't invest in crsrGoing to be as objective as possible so you don't get tricked by future posts trying to pump CRSR. 

1) **Bad fundamentals**. CRSR admitted they are projected to have 0% growth for 2022. They were only able to pump their stock price up when they IPO'ed because of the stimulus money helping their revenue growth significantly. CRSR is on a downward trajectory because hardly anyone is building new computers due to the graphic card prices or the chip shortage. Looking at the P/E, we could see CRSR go as low as $10 a share in the next few months since the gaming market is simply way too niche, meaning that growth is slim at best. Also, their projected next quarterly earnings are pretty bad if you look it up.

2) **Heavily shorted.**  As of right now, 31% of the float is being shorted which is way above normal. A normal stock at the most is generally shorted below 10% There is a strong negative sentiment for a reason. There may be more reasons beyond bad fundamentals for why it's being shorted. I won't throw around any baseless accusations since I don't have definitive proof of anything nefarious going on, but I will say there is generally a strong statistical correlation between fraud and a downtrend of a stock price. 

3) **Chip shortage.** This is obvious, but I'll say it anyway, with the war going on between Russia and Ukraine, the chip shortage will only continue to get worse since resources will be allocated elsewhere.

wallstreetbet,"[FTP] hey gamblers i figured it out - netting $5,000 to $6,000 a week for a few months nowbefore ya get too excited, there's kind of a high barrier to entry to do this....

i know this is casino and i'm a real estate puss that was always interested in stocks because that's where greedy people always end up so i started buying calls last year in batches of 5 to 10 but didn't like the volatility and time decay of doing that so i had to figure something out. i made money overall but then lost $1,600 on AMD calls when bubble went boop in January and that's not a significant amount to me but i hate losing. even playing COD against my gf i must win at all costs and if i don't i'm salty for a minute!!

So I wondered who the heck was selling these gambling tickets called options, thinking it was the brokerage and i found out it's people who own the underlying shares. They write covered calls against their shares and sell the calls and puts to degenerates like you while they collect the premium and you lose. so i started buying shares in bundles of 100 because it takes 100 shares to write a contract and wound up with 400 TSLA shares at some point. The premiums are very high for Tesla even those expiring the same week. i looked at Apple premiums and it's not worth it there for instance

what i did and do: i entered Tesla around $840 and bought 400 shares. so on a Monday I sell 4 covered calls against my shares to some gambler, usually around a 890 or 900 strike price that expires that same Friday. I collect my premiums of around $5,000 to $6,000 immediately and I just have to hold the stock til Friday (4 days) and when they expire worthless for the sucker who bought em, I keep the premiums i collected on Monday which are mine no matter what and I still have my shares to repeat this process again the next Monday. if i were ever assigned to sell my shares I would also make money on the sale because my cost to entry was $840 and the strikes are around 890 to 900 typically so i would net the difference there too. you kinda hope to get assigned! also the cost basis for your shares goes down as you collect premiums and hold the shares

so if i do get assigned, i'm forced to sell my shares and have no more shares but kept the premiums and i'm cash rich, here's what i do: i write puts and commit to buying Tesla at a certain strike, say 800 and collect premiums for doing that, usually around $1000 to $1400 based on current stock price. I just have to have the cash amount to buy 400 shares handy if i get assigned, i have a new share cost basis and can start selling covered calls again and if not i repeat the put writing on next Monday too lol. shout to the TD rep who told me how to do this at 2am when I called in with a bunch of annoying questions. ""the wheel strategy""

soooo the barrier to entry here is i had to have $300,000+ to buy the shares to start and another con is the stock price may fluctuate as you hold the shares but you still own the shares of a valuable company bae like Tesla, they don't expire like options. so that's the hack. i'm the casino and i sell lotto tickets to gamblers. I can hear the groaning now...OhhoOOOO OP you had $300,000+ to start doing this stupid rich boOi....well if it makes ya feel better about 6 or 7 years ago i was living in hollywood working as a barista with 12 roomates and i used to look through the sofa to collect change and i'd buy ramen and was so hungry i'd eat the ramen like chips on the way home before i could cook it. but i wasn't a little bitch, i went to work at a dealership and went from the bottom to the top of the food chain there then started flipping real estate. ah i remember having negative $400 in my chase college account like it was yesterday. my parents are the opposite of rich also so shut the fuck uhp

i wouldn't do this with a company like a dying movie theatre chain or a biotech [company.in](https://company.in) fact my watchlist is made up of 4 companies and i know em like a hawk. it has to be valuable company like Tesla or Amazon because you do own the shares at the end of the day but anyway i'm gonna go skate see ya wouldn't wanna be ya!"

‚ÄúAs the Western world scrambles to defend Ukraine by locking down Russian money, the company is acting as a broker between Moscow‚Äôs creditors and U.S. investors, pitching clients on the opportunity to take advantage of Russia‚Äôs war-crippled economy by buying its debt securities low now and selling them high later, according to four financial world sources familiar with the strategy. 

An investor who declined a Goldman trader‚Äôs offer to add Russian debt to his hedge fund‚Äôs portfolio ‚Äî because of the war ‚Äî said the trader suggested he could ‚Äújust put it in your personal account‚Äù to avoid scrutiny.

That does not violate the U.S. sanctions regime, but it is very different from the public face Goldman is putting on its relationship with Russia. In an emailed statement, Goldman is telling the public that it is ‚Äúwinding down‚Äù its business in Russia, portraying its actions as supportive of America‚Äôs effort to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.

* There is nothing illegal about brokering Russian debt trades. In fact, the Biden administration gave investment firms a green light to trade in Russian assets.*‚Äù"

wallstreetbet,"The Uranium P&amp;D that is being misrepresented here... Or is it?... DD? Opinion or something...So i been looking around the ol google trying to figure out why everyone started freaking out about Uranium 2 days ago before the initial run up it actually made sense. With that being said that is not the case today this is my first DD so please be gentile as im try to find as much info as possible incase im missing something and need to change up my position.

Full disclosure I do have ITM puts  so not sure if im for once on the right side of a WSB trade or actually am reading both the chart and the news cycle in correctly.

1st off there was a lot of debate earlier this week what type of sanctions Brandon was going to put on Russia  and we did get answers this week and with that being said Uranium is ""on the table"" as everything is on the table blah blah blah... the thing is US gets over 20% of its uranium from Russia so pulling the plug on that isn't as easy as pulling the plug on oil. But with that being said most nuke plants buy uranium in bulk and they have came out and said that there is no shortage in the US for a while to begin with. (They didn't specify if the stock pile is month or years, but they did mention that most rods last 6 to 12 month on average so i don't see them running out this year if i understand correctly )

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said I dont see a spike happening here but more just steady growth over time as all commodities have been growing with inflation its only natural that Uranium and everything else becomes more expensive.. and this bring me to my title! I personally believe that the recent spike was due to retail interest and a massive market scare and the stock is going to pull back unless it will be P&amp;D here and other places as Uranium is touted all over the news cycle. Good for some but a lot of ppl will get burned and its getting kinda old in my opinion as its getting more common here. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few other things to note.. Kazakhstan supplies 42% of the worlds Uranium and have been going through serious protest after the gov pulled the cap off of a special type of gas there resulting in massive protest and over 2500 ppl killed, tortured, or missing in January... however they did ""calm it down"" and re instated the cap on the gas for 6 month but the country is in complete media black out also Russia stepped in and helped stop the violent protests. Kazakhstan is a NATO country so there is also that but is very strategic for both China and Russia as well as the West so i personally dont see any supply interruption from sanctions as all the attention is on Ukraine from the world and most dont know wtf a Kazakhstan is or even where its located. 

&amp;#x200B;

In other news Iran is sitting on a massive stock pile of Uranium in violation of the JCOA agreement but US does not allow them to export so with the announcement today that the Iran peace talks today are falling apart i have no idea if this will be of any help just like the oil supply dilemma that our senior citizen elect is trying to un fuck atm...

 [Increase in uranium stockpile due to US ban on exports ‚Äì SightLine | U308 (sightlineu3o8.com)](https://sightlineu3o8.com/2019/07/increase-in-uranium-stockpile-due-to-us-ban-on-exports/) 

TLDR: I have no idea if Biden will sanction the largest Russia company that refines and sells over 20% of the uranium that we consume and doesn't seem very likely as we are already hurting pretty badly and no one in congress is pushing for a ban on Russian Uranium and Kazakhstan to a pretty firm stance and seem like they have the situation under control so at the moment i dont foresee any major interruptions in the near future but that could easily change if the fighting gets worse or if chemical weapons are used with that being said the price of Uranium will continue to climb with the overall commodities market as we are going through inflation but i firmly believe it will come in waves and will have periods of cooling and is really a long term investment rather then a short squeeze. 

I hope this helps some i spent all day digging into this and didnt really find anything that really jumped out at me as a pressing issue with supply currently, however the wild card here is Russia and we dont know what Putin will ban the export of in the future so far grain and sugar was on the list but not the main exports as they are hurting for cash."

stock,"$MULN is a confirmed short squeezeI have been reporting on the $MULN stock for 40 days between my YouTube,  Twitter and reddit pages. 

We are in a classic dilution war experienced many times in 2021. 
You can check the data to compare on $AMC $BBIG $PROG $IRNT $WKRS $DWAC and many others.  

Basically it works like this,  all the data companies only report on outstanding shares. If you look at the the 10-Q filings in the first few pages you will see mention of authorized shares versus outstanding shares versus preferred shares. Consider the outstanding shares outside of the preferred and net remaining authorized shares to be the public float. 

Now $AMC had 524M authorized shares and before the June squeeze of $12-$72 they diluted 450M shares. But before that they only diluted 120M shares at sub $5 the remaining 300M shares they diluted between $8-$20 with several smaller squeezes until the June $72 run up.  

Currently MULN started 2 months ago with 30M public float shares and 4 weeks ago ortex told us the outstanding shares grew to 188M with 150M shares owned by retail for 82% ownership.  2 weeks ago a muln sec filings stated the oustanding shares has grown to 240M shares and that they have 60M more shares to dilute at any price and they also introduced an offering that will give them 190M more shares to dilute when they exercise warrants at $8.84 or above stock price. I personally believe they will let this go much higher than $9 before diluting the fomo retail that chases the $MULN run up from $2.20 to $9 which is imminent.  

Good luck everyone and I hope you make all the life changing money you need!"

Question : Does it have a time period ? Like I borrow the stock from XYZ , do they have time period of when I should return it ? Can‚Äôt they just ask me to return their share when the market is high so they gain profit not when it‚Äôs low ? Also on what site can I short a stock ? Any platform for it ?"

Sens recently got insurance approval form anthem adding 45 million people that can now access Eversense CGM under insurance. This company has continually survived through hell and back with covid and then this recent recession and battling for FDA approval. This company imo has shown exceptional management to survive and overcome these obstacles. Not only this but the technology is there, the product is there. This is the of the most accurate CGM's out to date in terms of calculating blood sugar to the highest accuracy (yes better than dexcom). The way I look at it is this, this company currently has less than 1% of the diabetic market in the US. If they continue to grow and innovate there should be no reason why they don't capture more market share. Another interesting comparison to note is Dexcom's price per share back in the 08 recession got as low at $0.38 in Nov of 2008. Sens also had similar lows during covid and recently came back down into the $0.80 range before more than doubling recently on this news. I think even at $2 a share this company is a buy and will be a nice hold for the future. Their product pipeline is looking impeccable and they can eventually branch out laterally in the healthcare industry and make attempts at monitoring other variables other than glucose like blood chemistry variables or really any other blood component. I think the future can be very bright for a company like this."

stock,"Can The Board Of Directors Cheat Investors By Forcing Sale Of All SharesI was reading an article and saw that:

""if a larger company were to try to buy out the full company, they would have to pay a premium for the company to ensure that the board of directors and the majority of shareholders of that company agree with the acquisition. For example, they might have to pay $30 billion in order to buy a $25 billion market cap company, so that the board of directors agrees to it and signs off on all of the shares being transferred (even those shares of individual investors that might not have wanted to sell, since the legal entity itself gets absorbed into the buyer).""

In a hypothetical situation say that there's ABC Company that has a private investor that owns 20% of this private company. Can the owner of ABC Company (with majority 80% shareholding) force all 100% shares of the company to be sold to another company as an acquisition?

Or can each shareholder only decide to sell his own shares?

And does this differ for private or public companies?"

This is BS. Anytime before this modern day political climate we would have accepted Ukraine into the UN and told Russia to kick rocks‚Ä¶ 

But no, since Russia has strengthened its military and economic bonds with China we are playing a game of protecting all the UN lands around Ukraine.

What kind of a flex is ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt fight with you but we will spend tax payer money on your weapons‚Äù‚Ä¶  against the second largest military in the world‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs 250,000 vs 2 million.  With Russia having way more technical advantages. Making the military strength advantage 18/1  

So as Russia attacks Ukrainian men and women we will fly around it watching it happen. Just to make sure they don‚Äôt cross the wrong border‚Ä¶leaving Ukrainian people to die because we don‚Äôt have the balls to draw the line in the sand. 

We are the loud kid saying ‚Äúhit me‚Äù for his friends to think he are hard 

Russia supplies most of EuropeÔøº. With gas. Germany 100%. They have all the power in that geo political theater. And we are half ass acting like we are doing something. 

They just made plans with China to supply them with natural gas. If we shut down the nord stream 2 it has short term impacts on their economy ( and hurt Europe) makes us dig into our gas reserves. 
 
Our economy has  more than doubled in 1.5 years while most employers laid people off ‚Äúsars 2‚Äù And had a reduction in production

Anyone following the stock market knows this is insane and America is on the verge of another recession, with very few companies meeting EPS estimates with a negative future outlook 

The billions in stimulus and fed bond buying went to far. Currently sitting at a year over year inflation of 7.4  with fed talking about doing a full point raise by July. ( currently pricing in a .5-.75) And we are fearful of the impact of a primary military conflict would have on the economy, 

How about you think about that before you degrade the dollar by 12% ‚Äú actual‚Äù and send trillions to other countries while we let our local businesses fail  

A war with Russia would take crude price at a minimum to $117 a barrel and start us into a recession.  On the other hand we would have to get more involved in the war to counter the effects of supply chain and our dependence on foreign companies. Commodities go Brrrrr.

Yet they post record high earnings with record profit margins? It doesn't make sense to me or I'm not understanding it correctly.

The thought I'm having is:

CFO: Hey prices of (insert any input) has been rising due to supply shock. We have no choice but to increase our prices to MAINTAIN our margins or we'll report below street estimates on the bottom line due to increasing COGS.

CEO: Yes let's do that.

Comes earnings day.

CFO: Hey guys due to rising inputs we had to increase prices and we had better than expected pricing power as sales didn't go down. However we INCREASED our margins in sales to record high and are posting record bottom line figures.

CEO: Thanks guys times are tough

Hello all,

I am a 20yo M who has a little over 60k saved. I wanted to ask your opinions on whether I should buy a house here in California or if I should continue to invest and save. I would buy a 300k-400k house and use it as an rental property while I go out of state for the next 4-5 years as a USMC Officer. I have family here who I trust and would manage the property while I was gone. I was hoping to rent i out while I was gone and buy another house on military duty then buy another house when I come back to California after military duty. (I know California is a horrible place to buy. We are here primarily because of my wife‚Äôs family) I would buy a decent property that would require cosmetic fixes that I could do with my father in law that remodels house for a living. I currently have my 60000 in index funds and mutual funds. I guess I just wanted someone‚Äôs genuine opinion if buy a investment property now would be a good idea and then just starting to invest after I buy my first house. Every house I buy next would be with 0% down due to the VA loan.

Thanks I‚Äôm advanced for the answers."

stock,"Don't stocks inherently lose value as the dollar inflates?I haven't heard this discussed and I'm curious if my interpretation is correct and what that means for equities. Inflation is high right now, and the USD has inflated around 11% since 2020. In other words, $1 from 2020 could get you $1.11 today. This means that even if a stock stays flat for a year, its inherent value actually went down. 

With that in mind, you could say that the SPY at its $405 low was trading at around $365 in 2020 dollars. Only slightly more than it was at the peak before the COVID crash, about 7% higher (16% unadjusted for inflation). 

Is it fair to assess prices in this manner or is there something I'm not considering? Because I'm not sure I've ever heard a trader factor this in, even in this very high inflationary environment. People look at stock prices from the '90s and it seems incredible how far up we are, but the USD is worth half of what it was back then so you have to factor in that stock prices back then vs. now is only a fair comparison if you half the current prices. 

Thoughts?"
